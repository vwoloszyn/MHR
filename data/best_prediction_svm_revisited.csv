I researched for a couple of weeks. Using the internet of course and also asking friends who are or were familiar with units as civilians, law enforcement as well as a couple of former soldiers. Garmin was the brand that most of the guys came up with. Various units were discuss and after considerable time weighing the advantages and disadvantages of various models I made my decision. I purchased a Garmin 60csx. Once I had the unit I dove into the manual to learn the nuances of the device. GPS units are pretty amazing technology. I even delved into the different satellites that are in orbit and how they work.Here's some advice on buying a unit. First you need to ask yourself these questions.1. What do you want the device for? Do you only need a car unit? Do you plan to do anything off-road (hiking, camping, mountain biking, trail running) etc... Probably the most important consideration.2. What's your budget? That's the second big issue because buying the unit itself is just the beginning. More on that below.3. How small of a unit do you need? More than a shirt pocket size? A significant issue as the antenna on or in the unit plays a very significant role to the accuracy.For me I wanted something to use in the car and more importantly on the trail, in the woods. That lead me to look at accuracy issues with the cheaper models in wooded (under the canopy of trees) areas. The cheaper models just do not cut it when you go into the woods. The primary reason I chose the Garmin 60csx is because it is a WAAS compatible unit and it has the SiRF Star III chip set. Two critical systems that give you faster response from the GPS satellites and allow the signals to be captured by your unit under forest canopy. I can even pull signals inside my house and office if I'm close to a window. That's pretty impressive. I've gotten accuracy readings outdoors down to +/-9 ft. The 60csx is the same unit as the 60cx but it adds an electronic compass and a barometric altimeter (won't work in a pressurized airline cabin). Why not get all the bells and whistles when it adds just $20 to the unit? I generally leave the compass off to save battery power in the woods. I use my trusty analog compass I've had since the 70's. It doesn't need batteries and is proven reliable. I also won't go off the paths without a paper topo map. Navigational redundancy is a survival issue.Here's the deal you don't want to find out after the fact. Buying a $300 unit is just the beginning. The built in maps are very very basic. If you want updated road maps with listings like hospitals, restaurants, gas stations, banks etc... otherwise referred to as POI (points of interest) you'll have to spend another $120 for Garmin's proprietary software called City Navigator 2008 (North America in my case). Only Garmin's software will work on their units. To install the software you have to register the software and it is ""keyed"" to your unit. Antipiracy is the name of that game. Luckily, in my research I found out that CN 2008 was to be released about a month after I bought my unit. Knowing that in front saved me from buying the soon to be outdated V8 of that software. The other issue is memory capacity. My unit came with a 128MB Micro SD memory card. Certainly not enough to hold all the maps I wanted. I purchased a 2GB card ($20) via a friend which saved me a few bucks. Another tip on software. If you plan to do any land navigation and want topography maps again you'll have to buy Garmin's software. For serious hikers and navigators, you'll want to avoid Garmin Topo 2008. While it covers the entire country the aspect ratio of the maps is only 1:100. If you're used to USGS maps you'll know that you really want 1:24 maps. That said you have to settle for Garmin's National Parks maps. Which is fine with me. I bought the National Parks Topo 24 Eastcoast. A couple of final points regarding maps. I linked you to the NT version of City Navigator 2008. There are two versions of this map. The map data is the same. The NT version has a greater compression rate allowing you to put more or all of the maps onto your memory chip. BUT, the NT software is only compatible on certain units, so if you can use it, buy it. When you get ready to load your maps onto your unit make sure you pick all the maps you want at one time. Each time you load maps onto the memory card you wipe out the previous maps that were loaded (except for the unit's base maps). That said. I have all of the continental US road maps from CN 2008 NT as well as AL, GA, NC and SC National Parks Topo maps loaded on the 2GB card with about 250MB to spare in memory. Not bad! I don't have to worry about changing memory cards etc....I could go into greater detail about what I've learned but I'll recap a couple of things.1. Research what you want. There's a lot to know about GPS before buying. Do your homework.2. Factor in that you'll probably spend close to an additional $200 just for mapping software.3. Spending doesn't stop there. DC power cord for long road trips. Dash mount, bike handlebar mounts, batteries (more on batteries later). So figure on probably another $50-$100 for all the goodies you'll want.4. Get something to keep the unit in to protect it. I also recommend something to protect the screen from being scratched. Invisible Shield is supposed to be the hot set up. I had a packet of PDA screen savers laying around that I use on my PDA, iPod, Shot timer and cellphone screens that so far fits the bill.What starts as a $300 purchase quickly turns into $500+. I'm not one to skimp on quality when it comes to good kit. ;)","09 23, 2007",A3OS5M8BO19GWK,Hank Rearden,80.0,My thoughts on the 60csx,107.0,473.0,1190505600.0,1094.0,23.5464608216,11.6072558547,11.9392049669,0.126226898303,0.0,0.872893631819

I have a Samsung Galaxy S 4G phone so I liked that all of my apps would sync onto both devices, as well as streamlining my e-mail and other settings.  Win Win.  Or so I thought.Here are a couple of the major issues:DOES NOT SUPPORT FLASH-----Update: it does not support Flash, but you can do a couple of go arounds.  They are a bit of a pain.  I installed the Boat browser with an archived flash, and it works well.  But you cannot watch Amazon Prime in landscape view, just in portrait view.  But you can pop out the video so it fits the entire screen left to right, just while the device is in portrait.  I am still looking at various archived Flash versions as well as various other browsers.  Firefox to the rescue please!  (Still having trouble with street view unless you open Google maps in the other browsers).  Google, just give us a Flash app download please that works in your Android 4.1 Chrome browser!------------------So what does this mean?  Well currently I cannot watch my Amazon Prime videos on this tablet.  Instead, Google wants to charge me a monthly fee for Hulu Plus, or Netflix has an app for download.  But the question remains:  why should I pay for these services when Amazon offers a similar service for free?And with the non support of Flash come two very interesting problems: you cannot view the street view mode in Google maps (huh???) and many Youtube videos are not supported.  What gives Google?  Two Google programs that cannot run fully due to lack of supporting Flash?  I for one find this ludicrous.  If Google Maps and Youtube don't run fully without Flash, then why isn't Flash supported on the tablet?Now, for those techies that want to actually play Amazon Videos there is a way, though it doesn't work THAT well.  I actually installed Firefox by going to their website.  From Firefox you can look for an archived version of Flash for Android.  It will be a version compatible with an older Android version, but it WILL work.  Just not very well and not very clearly.  You will have to open Firefox and go directly to the Amazon website then go to Instant Movies and search for your favorite.  I am watching Star Trek TNG and it comes in decently, though some issues with sound and fuzzy appearance at times.  But it's better than nothing until Amazon releases an app (which I hope they will).  I also hope that Google will fix their street view system as well.I will be experimenting with various other archived versions of Flash and Firefox until I find a good match, then I will post in comments.  If you are just playing with Firefox and Flash, then you are not risking anything to your tablet.  Just only use the Flash downloads FROM Adobe's website.But enough of my rant about the lack of Flash support.  Other than that glaring problem there is one more issue, which I am glad to address:  unscrupulous sales of this tablet.  Even Google tried to charge me sales tax (I live in Oregon - no sales tax) and shipping.  Making the total for an 8GB over $250.  So here is the answer:BUY FROM STAPLES.COM :Sorry to recommend someone other than Amazon, but since you can't buy directly from Amazon, you have to pay a larger markup for purchase from a 3rd party seller.  Staples did not charge sales tax, and shipping was free.  It took two days to arrive.  I cannot express how happy I was with that purchase.  They only had the 16GB, but it still cost less in the end than the 8GB directly from Google.  And I still got my $25 Google Play credit.The other factor to point out is Wi-Fi only.  But at $250, I really can't complain.  If you really need a 3G/4G tablet, they do have those and you will spend a pretty penny.Also, no SD slot, but since Google is trying to encourage folks to load content into their 'drive' (their version of a virtual cloud) it seems that 16GB is enough to load many books and apps.  You won't be loading much media onto the device if you're using Hulu Plus, Google Play, or Netflix.  If you have music, I recommend loading it into the Amazon MP3 Cloud, which there is an app for that is compatible with this device.There is a micro USB port, so my Samsung chargers all work with this tablet as well.  You can also connect the tablet to a PC with a micro to standard USB.  I would also suspect that you might be able to use SD memory somehow if you have an SD reader plugged into a USB to micro USB cable.  I am not sure how to make the tablet 'see' the SD card in this instance, but I am sure there would be a software download that would work.  I haven't tried it because I use Amazon Cloud for most of my music.The tablet is actually pretty amazing despite the many flaws listed above.  If you are using it as intended: an E-reader (compatible with Amazon Kindle App), a browser (Chrome really is the best browser for speed/functionality), and a media device (if you are using Netflix, Hulu Plus, Youtube (for most videos), and Google Play).  I have also installed NES and SNES apps and downloaded a few ROMS and play classic games.  There are also many games and various apps for a variety of uses.  You can also load a Google map into the tablet to view offline if need be.  Sadly, I would just use my 4G phone with Google maps in that instance.So why buy this tablet?  Well I would say that perhaps I should have bought an Amazon Kindle Fire.  I miss my Amazon streaming video.  But the ability to sync my phone and use the same apps is a huge plus.  Having Chrome as the default browser is also huge.  Access to the variety of Android ready apps is really one of the best aspects of this tablet.  It does have an HD screen, though slightly less color than the iPad (at $250 less though).  The screen is also half the size of the iPad.  But that's not a bad thing.This is a very portable tablet, unlike the larger, nearly laptop size iPad.  I have a laptop already, so why would I buy a tablet that is less amazing than my laptop when it's about the same size and nearly as weighty?  Granted, if you are going sans laptop, the iPad is a great device.But for a portable (smaller) tablet with lots of bells and whistles, and impressive hardware, you really have the Google Nexus 7, the Samsung Galaxy Tab, and the Kindle Fire.  Each has pros and cons, but for ease of use, hardware, and connectivity I think the Nexus 7 wins.  Though the Nexus has its share of flaws, if I had to go back and buy one again, it would probably be the Nexus.  The Samsung is impressive, and my Galaxy S phone has been perfect; but with the newer version, it also lacks the Flash compatibility, though it has an SD card slot.  The Kindle Fire is an e-reader first and foremost, with decent media use, but not as functional as the Nexus; though it does have Android 4.0.  It really depends on what you are looking for in a tablet.I can say I'm happy with the Nexus 7.  I think there are a few issues Google should address.  Mainly adding Flash would help.  An Amazon Instant Video app would help too (hint hint Amazon).  Amazon just released one for the iPad, so hopefully it's coming.  In my humble opinion, all three mainstream tablets are amazing and competitive devices.+++Pros: Heavy duty screen, great HD display, lightweight, smaller than Kindle HD (less bevel), fast wi-fi, access to thousands of apps via Google Play, access to Amazon MP3 cloud, decent 16GB hard drive, impressive Nvidia graphics, and 10 hour battery.---Cons: Lack of Flash, currently no Amazon Instant Movie app, no 3g/4g model, no SD slot, only front facing camera (no rear).Verdict: you should seriously consider this tablet or the Kindle Fire HD.  Both are the best in the $200-$250 range at this time.  Or wait for the iPad mini.","10 7, 2012",A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""",74.0,"A couple of major issues, please read before purchase ~",7.0,515.0,1349568000.0,1456.0,27.9374980164,13.8916308291,14.0458671873,0.10698950534,0.0,0.872848960986

I have been an avid gamer and pretty much owned every single console, except sega, throughout the years.First: Xbox was packaged really great, and I always love a glossy finish but at the sametime with these consoles or tv's, it's a bitch. I'm not complaining though, such a stupid and petty complaint. Setup was easy, knew what to do without even the manual. The update took 5mins to download on a 20mbs download connection, so obviously their servers were also doing very well. Handles pretty much everything great, the kinect cuts out sometimes during games (like BF4) where it can recognize your face, but then apparently it says I'm not there. Apparently my blanket covering me up to my chest makes me &#34;invisible&#34;, no matter cold is rare here in Texas! As for COD: Ghosts, it's just like any other COD. Same crap, different shell, name, few new weapons. Unfortunately with these new-generation consoles there isn't many titles to entertain yourself with. Oh and... The installation times are... ab...so..lu..te..ly.. slow. COD Ghosts took about 45minutes just to get to 20%, and then it shotgunned it from there, such a weird thing. Maybe it was transferring a huge ass file that contained a large amount of data, not really sure. I haven't exactly checked but I did hear Ghosts takes 40gb, so nearly everybody will need a new harddrive after a while, since 500gb will fill up pretty quickly. Battlefield 4? BAD ASS! Great graphical improvement from BF3, graphics that I didn't even imagine were improved. So realistic! You can control the look of your guy in a vehicle by the turn of your head(with kinect and if you give it permission in settings). Makes it totally easy to call out commands (medic, ammo, etc), and you can also just tell it to like &#34;Next spawn as recon&#34; or whatever. Great game! I totally suggest BF4 over Ghosts, since Ghosts is strictly full of campers. The one bad thing about BF4 is that it's team-oriented, and I don't mean to say this that it's bad; more like it's a catch 22. You have to be a good sport in order to play the game, because you're going to lose a decent amount unless you have some friends or people with mics with you. Campaign is beautiful and load times are great. I've been getting lag while on BF4, not sure what it is. Something with the graphics, EA, the servers, my internet, the xbox? No idea.. I have close to 2mbs/1.5mbs(D/U). Never had any issues with games previously, but seeing as it's next gen maybe it is my internet; who knows. There are a few quirks out there, can't recall any for myself. The Xbox sometimes hears my commands wrong, but whatever, it's just launch! Have to have some patience! I'm sure they could've done a huge major overhaul, but if people had to download more than 500mb on launch day, people would've been crying 24/7. Anyway, yes I was a ps2 fanboy turned Xbox 360 fanboy. Didn't care for the ps3, but loved my Xbox 360. Most people who experience RROD are of their own doing. Constantly leaving it on, not giving it air circulation, etc. That's probably going to be the same with this console, but I have to say that the air circulation is magnificent! It's quiet, I do not hear a damn thing. The system doesn't even get louder under load(like a heavy graphical game like BF4). The kinect also is able to still hear my voice and commands while it's right next to my 5.1 surround sound, pretty damn satisfied by that. The free mic isn't bad at all, am pretty pissed off that my wireless mics from xbox 360 are useless, I'm sure they could've had a converter or something. Many friends are upset about the new mic plug, but it's just another way for microsoft to make money and for it's fellow companys to make money. It's all about money... I also was able to setup my Xbox to detect my audio(Logitech z-5500) and it controls that independently, with the say of xbox volume up/down, and my favorite feature... It's able to turn my tv, xbox, and audio receiver on or off when saying Xbox On/Off! Very happy about this so far!!!Lastly: People criticize Sony or Microsoft for having problems, well they unfortunately can't check every individual console and something's might just occur during shipping. Most of this crap is probably all made in China, so freighter, airlifting, trucking, and then people handling, and then you handling it all &#34;jiggles&#34; everything inside a bit &#34;more specifically the hard drive&#34;. It's up to you to decide, do you want an &#34;apple&#34; or an &#34;orange&#34;?

Some people may not give a second thought to spending upwards of $400 on the latest tech toy, but I do. Even though I got my PlayBook for $200 from Office Depot, it's still a significant investment in my book.Now - I am a fan of RIM, but I assure you I thoroughly researched all available tablets, I played with them in stores, I talked to tablet owners, etc. I am also an ex-professional IT nerd who still keeps up with things. I have also owned Android phones and an iPod Touch, hence I am very familiar with Android and iOS.The technological argument: The PlayBook uses QNX. It's a true multi-thread operating system. Rather than try to give you a tech 101 lesson, I will say if you are tech inclined, just Google it and read for yourself.As for Android, I don't like it. That surprised me because I am primarily a Linux user at home, leading me to believe that Android would be great. In short, Android is a huge data pig, with security holes and massive inefficiencies.iOS may be a derivative of Mac OS which is Unix based... Which is better than Windows in my book, but iOS also leaves a lot to be desired, including lag, memory inefficiencies, and other things I'll cover in the user experience assessment.The Hardware Argument: the PlayBook, like all RIM products, feels solid and dependable. The size is perfect, and balances nicely in your hand. The back has a nice silicone type coating making it just grippy enough to hang on to securely while not being obtrusive. I don't feel like I have to handle it with kidskin gloves for fear of damaging a glossy exterior. When I got my iPod Touch I immediately had to spend an extra $45 to get the Invisible Shield (a great product btw) so the shiny aluminium back and delicate screen wouldn't get destroyed, plus a silicone skin for some added impact protection. Be honest - how many iPhones have you seen with shattered screens? Exactly. If you look at an Apple product cross eyed, the damn thing breaks. All the Android tablets felt equally flimsy to me. As for the eReaders that are adding Web and video capabilities, I remind you that they are just that: an eReader. The additional features are disappointing underperformers.The PlayBook screen quality is astounding. Everything on it, including video, looks better than my Desktop LCD monitor. Seriously.The speakers are equally wonderful. They sound better than my sister's fancy-pants new laptop. Incidentally, I'm a musician... So yeah - that matters.For connections, the HDMI port is (blessedly) separate, instead of the absurd proprietary single port that the iOS devices have. This means I can run video out from my PlayBook while charging if I need to. The USB input is nice too for us fast typists when the Bluetooth keyboards will lag.It has a front and rear camera, I'll admit I haven't yet played with them.User Experience: in an attempt to shorten this somewhat, I will say that the multi-tasking is seamless, the gestures are super intuitive, the full Web browsing experience WITH FLASH support is great. I have had zero issues with lag or freezing or anything of the sort. I especially appreciate the buttonless experience. I was admittedly sceptical, but it took me all of a few hours to get it down to second nature. I should also point out that the devices with the multi-function ""home/exit/etc"" button will, eventually fail, as my iOS device started doing recently.I must highlight the Predictive Text - it is eerily accurate. I have written entire sentences by only entering the first few letters of a few of the words and had the rest suggested. It is also very nice to once again have the ability to edit my own custom dictionary, which iOS would inexplicably not let me do.Battery life: I've been playing with this constantly for the last 5 hours and am at 60%. I have no complaints.The Great App Debate:Apple's App Store currently has over 700,000 apps.Android Market claims... Well, no one seems to know, or I can't seem to find an official number anyway. We can say at least 400,000 though.BlackBerry AppWorld: I'm hearing around 100,000.Yep. That's a lot less. I don't know about you, but frankly I'm more interested in quality than quantity.I can tell you, of the 119 Apps I have installed on my iPod Touch, I use 16 of them regularly; at least 5 of those are really just glorified Web links.16. 16 Apps. I mean, come on people - how many Turkey Call Mimics or versions of solitaire do you need???Yes, there are a few Apps I wish were on BB AppWorld, but it's nothing I can't accomplish via the web browser.Finally, to address some misconceptions and unfair criticisms:Complaints that there is no Expandable SD Memory card reader: well, the beloved iPad doesn't have one either. I can't see using up my entire 64 GB PlayBook, but even so I can access Cloud storage all the same.Complaints that there (was not at first) a cellular capable model: well, if y'all really like paying extra money for a superfluous wireless plan, you got it. The 4G/Wifi model is rolling out now. May I also point out that the iPad Wifi only model far outsells the cellular model.You do NOT need to have a BlackBerry phone for Internet Tethering. Any mobile capable of tethering will work. Apparently depending on your carrier you may get extra Tethering charges, but that varies.Bonus: RIM assures us that BlackBerry 10 OS will be available for the PlayBook.At the end of the day, I bought the PlayBook to get real work done on the go, without lugging around a big old laptop. The PlayBook is delivering in spades.I had high hopes and was so afraid I would be let down. I have not been let down yet.********** Update: I have now tested the cameras and microphone and I am really pleased.The camera takes really nice photos, plus it has a really cool stabilisation feature. I do wish it had an LED flash but I guess you can't have it all. Also, my Dad is getting a PlayBook now so we can video chat, which will be really nice.The microphone is awesome. I need it primarily for recording workshops, and audio at rehearsals. I tested it first by having my husband speak while I deliberately left the television on to see how it would handle competing background noise. The resulting audio was clear and I didn't have to strain to separate the speech from the background noise.I then did some quick instrumental recording and that sounded great as well. I wouldn't be recording an album with it or anything but it was near demo quality.

Setup wasn't totally painless, however.I currently own four optical-disk-playing devices (not counting computer drives).  I have a five-disk Sony DVD carousel, a Samsung BD player(with wireless but with minimal features, mainly Pandora, Netflix, Blockbuster, and some news headlines), a slightly older Sony BD player(BDP-570) which has, up until now, been the main unit in my entertainment center, and now this.I'm reasonably pleased that the user interface is essentially unaltered from my earlier Sony BD device.  The interface is still very easy to use, and very intuitive.  It DOES, however, have the annoyance of lacking some configurability (I'd sure like to be able to remove the ""Michael Jackson channel"" from my list of video channels, for example, as I'll never...

But if you've owned a Sony BD device before, the UI will be totally familiar to you, as will most of the main configuration options.The remote control is also very similar to the older Sony remote, except that some of the special functions are now in a secondary, concentric ring around the nav-select pad... which is actually a BAD thing as far as I'm concerned, as I have found myself frequently accidentally hitting the outside ring when I'm trying to hit the inside ring, or vice-versa.  Fortunately for me, I seldom use the provided remote, instead using my Logitech Harmony programmable remote...  so this is not really an issue.  But if you plan to use this remote as your primary control, I suspect you'll experience the same thing from time to time.  Sony could have done better in this regard.Picture quality is gorgeous, of course, as played on my 240hz Samsung 3D LEDTV.  I wasn't sure that there would be any visible difference, but the image quality is notable improved, especially on upscaled DVD images.  It seems that the two fast processor cores in the machine are getting a pretty robust workout... they're not being wasted!  3D is impressive, too... though I suspect this is more related to the TV than the player.  (Samsung's 3D TVs are the best on the market IMHO, right now, though Sony's BD players are the best, I think!)  That said, the machine never so much as ""hesitates a frame"" in even the most action-packed 3D scenes...  which is something you'll occasionally note on lower-end 3D units, as the data streaming through them can briefly get backed up in fast, moving scenes, being rendered twice-over for each frame (once per eye, in other words).I do not have access to a 4K display, so I have no idea if that's good or not.  I suspect that 4K will tax the resources of this machine...  then again, so few people have 4K displays right now, it's not worth quibbling about.Now...  if you buy one of the first units (ie, the current batch, I think!), you'll likely have a few issues when you first obtain it.  The machine is designed to be network-connected, and wants to be connected.  But, at least in my case, and in the case of many others, the network functionality seems somewhat hobbled under the ""release firmware.""  You need to update the machine's firmware...  after which, my machine has worked perfectly.  But the device, by default, will try to ""web update"" itself anytime connected.  Which means that you need to manually update the device, using either downloaded media (from the vendor's website), media obtained from the vendor (for a fee), or at the very least, a hard-wired network connection, in order to do your first update.Prior to the first update, I had significant difficulties maintaining a connection...  which could lead to an improper update, and a ""bricked"" device.  Lots of other folks had the same problem.  Post-update, my device works perfectly.  Also pre-update, I couldn't manually enter my wireless networking info (the UI was there, but it didn't allow me to finish my setup).  Post-update, that's no longer an issue.The receiver in this device isn't tremendously powerful, and a better antenna/receiver set would be a major boon.  It's basically on-par with devices built into laptops and so forth, and (post-update) works about the same as any of those.  But it would be well-served by having some improved reception, since it's going to be tasked with streaming a lot of data.  The reception is better than you'll get with a Roku or the like, but not as good as it ought to be for the price, and if you're not near your router, you may have some connectivity issues from time to time.  It does seem to be on-par with my prior Sony device, or the built-in wireless in any of my TVs.That's about all I can say about it right now.  It's a terrific device, plays back flawlessly for any media I have access to, and just generally is the best device of its type out there right now, as far as I'm concerned.  Just be careful about updating the device when you first receive it.  I recommend downloading the update files and installing them without the network at all (see Sony's support site).  After doing this, my network has worked flawlessly so far, and the device is separated from my router by a floor and four walls, and about fifty feet... and we have power lines nearby.I'm very satisfied with the device so far.  If that ever changes, I'll be sure to update this review, though.*************Edit:  Well, I've had this for a while now and have fully put it through its paces.  There's one thing I thought I ought to mention.This has the best DLNA interface I've yet to see on a consumer device.  It's easy to use, functions well...  but there's a problem.  It only recognizes a tiny subset of my media, including very, very few of my video files...  very few.  And while it will recognize any MP3 file, most of my media is in WMA format, which the player won't recognize, either.  So, the DLNA functionality is pretty hobbled, as far as I'm concerned.  I'd love to hear the experiences of others in this regard.No support for windows media audio and video?  No support for MKV containers?  These are things that really should be present in ANY contemporary media-streaming solution.  Hopefully Sony can implement something (it's not a hardware issue so it MUST be a legal-rights issue!) to manage file types better in the future.Right now, the only device I have which can make full use of my media server, with the exception of actual PCs, is my little Archos portable media player.  I sure wish my Sony BD player had support for as many file times as my Archos does...*************Another edit:I've now had two more firmware updates since posting the above.  And yesterday, I decided to play around with the network DLNA mode again.  I don't know which firmware fixed this, but as of yesterday, I can now play WMA audio files with no problems.I still can't see any of my WMV, DIVX, MOV, or other video files.  The only things I CAN see, really, are the transport stream files taken directly from DVD rips, and I only have a handful of those, created off of disks I own, so that I could put those files onto my portable player (Archos 5IT, 500GB).So... it does seem that Sony is ""fixing"" the DLNA issues, but a step at a time.  I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of my stuff... video files, etc...  someday soon.","06 9, 2012",A3MU9G6YWKTGTA,Cary L.

They have announced that they are getting out of the navigational hardware business and hope to sell some of their connected technology to auto manufacturers.  Most of the employees were laid off.  Thus, if you are contemplating purchase of a Dash, be aware that it will inevitably  be an obsolete brick, with no significant updates or support forthcoming.  Mine now goes to the museum, I just replaced it with a Magellan 4370.  The Dash was a great idea but it just never panned out.Update #3:August 2008The bad news is that it broke.  The touch screen threw itself out of alignment (apparently a number of Dash owners have experienced this). This meant that you can not get past the legal disclaimer page. Fixing it necesitated a return.The good news is that Dash support was superb.  The phone was answered quickly.  I was given the option of returning it for repair or else having them send me a new unit and a return label for the broken one.  The new one was shipped out right away via 2 day UPS.Routing remains an issue.  Dash is now saying that an updated routing algorithm will not be available until end of year.  Hopefully, for Dash's sake, they have this ready prior to the holiday buting surge.Update #2:The June update was indeed released.  It introduced a few new features and improved the interface in a few areas.  Unfortunately, we have still not seen a revised routing algorithm and the DE continues to send users in 50 mile circles as it strives to stay on major highways no matter what.  Dash states they are working on improvements but no dates have been provided.  Just this month I bought a GPS as a gift for a colleague.  I considered the DE but instead opted for a Garmin solely because of the routing issues.Update #1.Having lived with the DE for over a month now, I would give it a C+ for current state with an A for potential.  The routing algorithms seem to have some significant issues.  That is not good considering the primary function of a PND.  This is a device I really want to love but the flaws are tough to overlook.  A major new software update is pending this month so hopes are high that it will address many of the issues, especially with routing.On a recent trip from Philadelphia to Ocean City, MD I experienced.  1)  Less than optimal routing (only one choice given vs. 3 from TomTom), a lock up that required hard reboot, at one point it told me to make a hard left turn onto rte 13.  This was in the middle of the highway and made no sense from any perspective at all.  Unfortunately, when traveling in unfamiliar territory, I still grab the Magellan or the TomTom.  (I am one who thinks the Garmin's have been dumbed down in their interface).Early adopters saw a price drop of $100 (25%) within two months of release.  Dash did not go as far as Apple in offering an equivalent service credit to early adopters but did recently give us 3 months of additional service.  B- for customer focus.A new release of software is promised soon.  Hopefully, this will address some of the shortcomings and raise the grade to a B+ or an A.  If this is your ONLY gps, you might want to wait a couple of months.  You may also benefit from further price drops.============================================================First off, let me state that I am NOT a beta participant.  I bought my DASH with my own $$$.  I have also owned many different GPS units starting with a Garmin GPS III when they simply showed you where you are.  I love gadgets.  I own or have used current Garmins, Magellans, TomToms, and manufacturer equipped vehicles.  I have also returned a few that I did not like thanks to Amazon's excellent customer service.  I had been watching development of the Dash for some time and even though they rejected me for the beta, I decided to buy one.  I had some reservations as I discredited the ""best thing since canned beer"" fanboys who got one for free as beta participants.  On the other hand, there seemed to be a lot of negative comments from non-owners as well.After a few days of ownership, I do think the Dash is a game changer for GPS units.  It raises the bar by offering something really new and unique.  It has its shortcomings, most of which will likely be addressed in new software releases, others will need new hardware.After reading the comments about how huge the Dash is I was worried about what I would see in the box.  My first thought on unpacking was, ""eh, it ain't that bad"".  This is definitely not something to slip in your shirt pocket but is no more bulky than the Roadmate 700 series, the StreetPilots, or even the softball shaped TomTom 900 series.  Once it is mounted to the windshield, you only see the screen and the size becomes a non-issue.  If I were flying from city to city it would not be my first choice to carry.  Yes, it could be sleeker but the average person who will keep it in his car, it is a non-issue.  The windshield mount is extremely sturdy, probably the best design I have seen  If you want to see a junk mount, try a TomTom 900 series.Upon powering her up she took about 3-4 minutes to get locked in and ready to go.  On subsequent restarts the signal aquisition was within 30 seconds.  What really surprised me was that I almost immediately saw both dashed and solid lines indicating other users on nearby highways.  I thought I would be the only kid on the block for at least a few weeks.  The menus seem very well laid out and logical. The display does not provide as many geographic landmarks as some but it is very clear and easy to read.  Instead of an arrow you have an image of a car.  A clever touch although I did see someone griping about not being able to have an arrow, get over it!At this point I have only about 200 miles on her so I will update this review as time progresses.  Here are my initial observations.  Some people have observed drifting of actual versus displayed position.  I have not seen this as of yet.  Even in areas where a bunch of roads run parallel, the tracking was spot on.  I have also yet to experience problems with screen refreshes.The ""send to"" feature is nice and works well.  The Yahoo search for POI's is excellent.  Sure, Google is better but what Dash offers is leap years ahead of even the most comprehensive set of built in POI's.The routing algorithms definitely need some work.  As others have noted, it sometimes proposes some outright bizzare choices.  I suspect this will be addressed in upcoming software releases but is currently the Dash's greatest weakness.  Most of the time the routes are OK but enough are not to raise concern.  There is also a definite tendency to force you to a main road even when a secondary makes much more sense.  Some people may blame this on use of teleAtlas versus NavTeq maps.  I have other units with current versions of both.  The differences between the two have really become negligible.The ability to choose among ""avoid highways"", ""most use of highways"", ""avoid toll roads"", etc. is a related item that will hopefully be addressed soon. Likewise, the ability to easily exclude a road is important.Auto-zoom on approach of turns is needed.The text to speech is functional but needs some tweaking.It was an unfortunate decision not to bluetooth enable the Dash.  Having your GPS serve as a wireless speakerphone is really helpful.  Unfortunately, I do not see this being supported until the next generation of Dash hardware.The button placement may cause you to inadvertently tap one for about your first minute of ownership.  Personally, I like the idea of having buttons to quickly adjust volume, go to the main menu, etc.  No qualms here.Dash seems very committed to addressing shortcomings, updating the software, and adding value over time.  If they do this quickly and consistently they are to be commended.  I always appreciated how Magellan made major new features available to the older Roadmates without requiring you to buy new hardware (unlike some other GPS manufacturers who only provide minor software updates).  Let's hope that Dash delivers on its promises.Yes, you can get sexier hardware.  Yes, the Dash routing engine needs some fixing and there are some features that are still lacking.  But I do think that networking of GPS raises the bar to a whole new level and I am thus willing to make an early investment.  The strenghts seem to outeigh the weaknesses and I do believe that within 6 months most of those weaknesses can and will be addressed.Two years from now these features may be common place.  Dash does need to act fast and stop making stupid excuses about the poor routing like, ""well, the primary market is commuters"".  Dash will either become an industry leader or else a page in the history books.  I suspect that they will become a big player.","04 15, 2008",A2KF3H5304I4IA,Michael A.

Mostly better than any dslr or mirrorless ones.11. CompactCons1. No External flash or VF connector (I think it is understandable issue. Because I saw Panasonic's LX7 design yesterday. And Design is so ugly. To me Don't want spend money to get expensive accessaries for compact camera. People doesn't want to spend extra money for that.. I believe. Instead of that, Internal flash is really working great.)2. Grip? (I am a big fan of gr digital or lumix LX series grip but for this camera. Without rubber grip, it makes much sharper and cool design. Yes. I want minimized design from Sony. I believe Leica X series has same issue and they are selling extra grip with very expensive price tag. And original leather case is supporting for this part well)3. No battery charger? Yep. I want battery charger.4. No WiFi? Um.. Actually Heavy photo files can be transferred by usb cable I think. no necessary with 20M pixel camera especially. This is seriously compact for professional or mania. GPS? yep... with gps and price higher is not good solution but same price with GPS feature. that will be great.5. Price... well. little expensive..6. 28mm Wide. 24mm or 25mm is very common spec now a days. First, Yes. I like 24mm Wide lens for landscape but also I like 28mm classic wide lens. In my memory, 28mm, 35mm, and 50mm is my old basic 3 lenses always. 28mm is better than 24mm's distortion and low light at corner issue and feel that is enough. also it is very useful for 5-6people shot at short distance. 35mm lens is classic. it is great for everywhere. portrait or landscape, especially street snap. 50mm is really good for portrait. Most of baby photo is from 50mm. On Automatic mode of RX100, easily change. there is 28mm-35mm-50mm - something like this. If there is 24mm option that will be great but without 24mm it is okay. This is luxury coated lens and classical 28mm.Thank you.","07 19, 2012",A25EK504ROX677,Jaden P,58.0,How close your camera with you? Everyday Point and Shoot.

But then the Kindle Fire HD 7"" came out a few weeks ago, or so, and I grabbed one. Love it!! With a few minor things on the down side.Pros:1) It's thin and relatively light. If they ever get these things down to the weight of a regular Kindle, (the e-ink, black and white, variety, which weighs nothing), then it would rule the world.2) The interface is really nice. Easy to use and pleasing to the eye, and everything is consistent between menu's. This is why the iPad is so well liked. Some people prefer being able to customize their Android tablet, but I've come to appreciate the uniformity. The beauty with the Kindle Fire HD is that you can also add on a different ""launcher"" - like ADW Launcher EX Pro. You have to ""side load"" it, which means you need to find the .apk file for it and copy it to the Kindle manually, as it won't be available in the Amazon Store. But that's nothing. Google it and download it to your Fire HD, right from the browser on it.3) As much as I have resisted the 7"" format, the Kindle Fire HD overcomes my problems with that size. Mainly, because the icons are big, the text is readable everywhere, and the main reason I use a tablet is for reading magazines, and until now, the 7"" form factor has been too small, text-wise, for me to read them, and you can't zoom in on magazines. That is actually still the case with magazines you buy on the Amazon Store, BUT, if you buy them off the Google Play Store, then they're zoomable!! The catch there is that in order to buy from the Google Play Store, you have to root the device and side load a few .apk's to get to the Google Play Store to buy mags from there and use their app. No big deal, and it worked for me.  But its not for everyone.  If zooming in on magazines is your thing, you might want to wait for the 8.9"" Fire HD to come out in November.4) It has built-in capability to turn itself off when you close certain cases for it. Starts up again when you open the case. Like the iPad.5) It has Bluetooth, so I can stream music or Pandora to Bluetooth speakers, (I highly, highly, recommend the Monster ClarityHD Micro, for $199. It can also be used as a speakerphone and takes voice commands. For another $100, the Bose Soundlink is tough to beat, but not sure it works as a speakerphone.). It also has dual WiFi antennaes, though I don't see any big difference in speed, so far.6) Battery life seems to be great - about 9 hours, constant, heavy use. Days of normal reading.7) Two speakers!! That sound GREAT - even fully cranked up. Not much bass, but that's to be expected. Sounds really good and gets surprsingly loud, without distortion.  Highly recommend you use a music player that has an equalizer, (Player Pro does, and I think WinAmp does, as well.  The stock one doesn't - which is a bummer.).8) GREAT display. Really rich colors. It beat the Google Nexus 7 in a big way. In fact, it beats the iPad 2 and comes close to the iPad 3 - no discernible difference. I'm talking about official lab testing kind of thing here. It's a Retina screen, just like the iPhone and iPad 3. It's also Gorilla Glass, so it won't break easily, (like your pre-iPhone 5 iPhones do)For $199, I truly think this is an iPad alternative, for hundreds less, and it weighs less and is easier to hold in one hand.CONS:1) The 7"" version doesn't offer a 4G/LTE option. This is not a huge negative, as I can use my phone as a hotspot if I need to get on the Internet and WiFi is not available. I also have a MiFi hotspot thingy, so I'm covered. Amazon is offering a deal where you pay $50/YEAR for 250mb/month. That's enough to surf a bit and download books and what-not, but not for streaming lots of music or videos. I don't care, in that I would just download a movie or TV shows and watch them that way, or be near WiFi to watch.  I rarely watch anything on it, anyway.  Only on a plane, and there's no 4G there anyway.  Moot point.2) Though the Kindle Fire HD has a dual processor in it, I still find it sometimes slow to open apps and some lagginess here and there. More than there could be, if they had inserted a quad core chip instead of a dual core. Granted, most of that is when you open an app for the first time after a reboot, or whatever. Subsequent opens are quick. But it can take 4 seconds to open an app! Not sure how the iPad fares there. I know the Google Nexus 7 opens instantly, but it has a quad core processor in it. Having said that, it's not a deal breaker; just a wish list entry for the next version.3) Ads. Some people may have an issue with there being ads placed on the lock screen, (seen only when you first open the device), but I personally don't care. Others don't like that Amazon is always suggesting other apps or games or books that are related to what you're doing, but I, personally, kind of like that. It's done in a non-intrusive manner, and I find it more helpful than annoying. Also, for $15 you can turn off the ads on the lock screen. I intend to leave them on there, even though I usually hate ads. It's different in this case. And if it becomes annoying, I'll pay the $15. I don't see that happening, and I really do want to know what other apps or games other people like that are similar to what I've downloaded.All in all, I think it's a winner!  The 8.9"" is tempting, with the 4G, but I don't know if it's worth twice the price and the extra size when I really don't need it as long as I can zoom and pan in a browser - within reason - and same with magazines.  I will, however, take a close look at the 8.9"" when it comes out.EDIT:  I will add that I would love to have a microSD card built in, and I would dearly love to have an equalizer built into the music player, as I like it, but it doesn't take advantage of the speakers!!  This is an easy fix, Amazon.  How 'bout it? Also, I didn't realize it doesn't have a rear-facing camera.  That would be nice.  How many times are you Skyping your family or friends far away, and want to give them a tour of somewhere you are - like a new house or apartment, or hotel/resort?  It's fun to walk around and see what they're seeing.  Taking stills and videos is nice, too.  Also, it would be great to fix it so the carousel just kept your recent apps for a day, or two, perhaps.  Let the Favorites have a reason for existing; keep perhaps the last 10 apps or books accessed at all times, just to have something there - or give an option to keep the carousel to certain number of icons.

ISO is a camera's light sensitivity. the higher the number, the more sensitive the sensor is to light. but when increasing ISO you also increase noise levels in an image. noise is visible small dots on the image, it looks like grain. the ability of a camera to produce relatively noise free images at higher ISO is very important as it will allow you to shoot in lower and lower light conditions without using a flash. so as i've said, noise is very well controlled at ISO 800 and below, and acceptable at ISO 1600, unless you're going to be blowing up and printing large prints.if you can achieve adequate exposure you'll be very pleased with the image quality of the camera. the sensor delivers sharp, high contrast images. the auto focus system is very good, a hand me down from the mid level Nikon D90. in low light, low contrast conditions it can hunt for focus a bit, but that's common to all cameras. the kit lens (18-55mm f/3.5-5.6) is a decent all around starter lens for general photography. it's very capable of producing stunning images. all in all the image quality of this camera is beyond reproach. this new entry level camera is capable of images that older mid level cameras would be proud of (D90 i'm talking about you!).the camera body handles very well. it's a small and lightweight camera, the smallest dslr in Nikon's lineup. all the buttons and controls are clearly labeled, and intuitevely laid out. being an entry level camera it is somewhat lacking on controls. there is only one control wheel, which defaults to shutter speed. you have to hold the aperture button and use the wheel to adjust aperture. there is an FN (programable function button) that can be set to whatever function you'd like. i have ISO set to the FN button so i can change my iso without having to get into the on screen menu. the more expensive mid level and professional camerasa have more wheels and buttons to make on the fly adjustments as quick and easy as possible. but this is an entry level camera, so you shouldn't expect that. as is it's a very easy camera to handle. i dont have any issues with my adjustment settings. i shoot in M mode (manual control), and can easily adjust my ISO, shutter speed, and aperture on the fly with minimal fuss. and as i've gained experience shooting i can quickly and easily go into the on screen menu to adjust the more advanced features before i start my shooting. i suggest just shooting as much as possible to get used to the layout. before you know it you'll be changing settings on the fly like it's 2nd nature. when you do need to get into the onscreen menu you'll find it very intuitively laid out, and very logical to use. my first time using it i found everything i was looking for in menu without fuss. so as long as you're not expecting a professional layout, i think you'll be very happy handling the d3100.this camera does not have an internal auto focus motor, so be aware that you must use only the G series lenses (ex. Nikkor 35mm 1.8G lens). you'll see the ""G"" series marker after the max aperture on the lens description. G series lenses have an auto focus motor built into the lens itself, which allows it to auto focus on the camera bodies that lack such motor (hello d3100 and others!). you can still mount the D series lenes on the camera, but you'll have to manually focus with those lenses. i thought that was worth pointing out so you dont go buying this camera and a bunch of the D series lenses (which are cheaper). the good thing is in general the G series lenses are newer tech lenses and offer a small performance advantage over the D series (in general terms).so the camera offers great image quality, handles well, seems perfect doesn't it? yeah, but it's not. it's an entry level camera and as such omits some potentially important features. the camera doesnt offer exposure bracketing, which allows you to take a series of photos at incrimentally higher/lower exposures. for me this isn't a big deal at all. i've used a D90 and bracketing, and i found it to be of limited use for my beginner skills. the camera also does not support off camera flash via the CLS (Creative Lighting System) mode. what this means is you cannot remotely fire a speedlight flash (SB900-600) that isnt directly mounted on the camera. you'll have to go buy manual flash triggers. cheap ones can be had for under $40, but don't support iTTL (auto flash mode). the triggers that do support iTTL cost a few hundred. if you get into advanced lighting with your flash you'll want to set the light off camera to create direction to the light, to cast shadows and such. but you cant do that without cls support by the camera. so you either have to use manual triggers, or go buy a SB900 or SB700 and mount that on your camera, then buy another speedlight (SB900-600) and use that as your remote light. the SB900 and 700 can enable the cls system on the d3100, it's called commander mode. sorry if that's confusing, it's hard to explain. the bottom line is commander mode from the cls system is not supported by the d3100 unless you go out and buy an SB900 or SB700 speedlight. if you want to know more about commander mode and the cls system google it. the camera also does not support the mode Auto FP, a mode which allows for high speed sync (hss) with a flash. what this means is you're limited to 1/200 shutter speed when using flash. you cannot go faster. what does that mean? well hss is a great feature that if supported would allow you to sync your flash (not the pop up flash, but a seperate speedlight flash like the SB900 through 600) to your shutter at any speed. so you could still use your flash at the max shutter speed of the camera. this would allow you to greatly limit ambient light when out in sunlight, while still properly exposing your subject via the flash. and it's great to use to freeze motion, especially really fast moving subjects like birds/water/bugs etc. for me this was a huge ommission that i was totally unaware of when i purchsed the camera. i didnt find out till i got my new SB600 speedlight/flash. i tried to increase my shutter speed past 1/200 and it wouldnt go. after hours of reasearch i found out hss just wasnt possible on the d3100. i was really upset, i wont lie. in hindsight it's not that that big of a deal, it's just a limitation i have to be aware of. as mentioned earlier you have to use the G series lenses, which are more expensive. to me this isnt a big deal, i like the G series more than the D series anyways. the final shortcoming i'll mention is the lcd screen. at 230k dots it's a very low res screen. for comparison the D5100's screen is over 900k dots, almost 4 times the resolution. how this hurts is when you're shooting and your focus is slightly off, or the exposure is slightly off. on the lower res screen the image might seem ok, but when you get home you'll find the image isnt ok, it's a bit blurry or dark/light. this isnt a huge thing for me, more of a wish list item. great if it were better but can live with it as is. those are my major complaints, make of them what you will.all in all this is a great camera. if you're just starting out i highly recommend it. i will offer a suggestion to you, though. if you feel/think you're not going to grow and advance a lot in photography, and are just looking for a great camera that's a nice step up from a point and shoot, buy this camera, you'll love it. but...if you plan on growing your skills and becoming an advanced photographer, maybe save up more and get a mid level camera like the D7000. now why would i say that after gushing over the d3100 in my review? becuase as great as the d3100 is for a beginner, it IS a beginner camera. once you start getting into more advanced photography you're going to want some of the abilities that just aren't supported by the d3100. that's the boat i'm in. i LOVE my d3100, it's been amazing. i'm still blown away by some if the images i've been able to capture with it. but i fell in love with photography and i've started learning advanced techniques, and the d3100 isnt keeping up with me. but there usually are workarounds, so dont despair. and dont think the d3100 isnt a great camera, because it is. my last few statements were only directed to those who plan on becoming advanced photographers. for most people, especially those who will never even try to manual control the camera, the d3100 is plenty of camera for you, you won't be dissappointed.","03 4, 2011",A20YU3IR0637F9,eric,105.0,amazing camera for a beginner,23.0,548.0,1299196800.0,1822.0,15.1719965971,7.59427201228,7.57772458486,0.197876638992,0.0,0.873174778972

The controls are all intuitive, I can get to every setting I can imagine in very short order, the body fits my hand perfectly; it has to be the fastest camera I have ever seen.My previous most passionate camera love was a Canon EOS 10s. When 3 Megapixel cameras were finally somewhat perfected and cost over a thousand dollars, I gave up my 10s and a major batch of lenses, flashes, Minolta IV flash meter, and a ton of accessories for an Olympus smart media all in one camera. I loved digital, and put up with the camera (or learned how to work around its limitations). Then I progressed to a Canon S50, a Canon Powershot Pro1, and finally a Canon XTi. Image quality increased with each purchase, and there were fewer and fewer compromises. When I finally picked up this 7D, I fell in love. No it wasn't love at first sight; it took bolting this camera to a 300mm f2.8 beast and working a football game that sealed my love.Finally a digital camera that works and feels a lot like the original best of the class 35mm film cameras. I guess the EOS 1 series has always done that, but that camera has always been way out of my price range. I have large hands, and the 7D fits perfectly in my hand. Every single button is exactly where I need it. Make no mistake; this is a very large camera. It is probably a good 25% larger than an XTi / XSi / T1i. It is a little bit heavier than those cameras, but not a huge amount.On a purely still photography level, I can't imagine a more perfect camera. If you do any sports photography and are on the fence over this camera and the T1i, stop thinking and just buy this 7D. The high speed frame capture is incredible. I've photographed my son playing football for six years; he's now a sophomore playing football at college. I was pretty good at anticipating the best moment to take the picture (even with that PowerShot Pro1 I got some darn good pictures). But bolting on 8 frames per second, peak action is a given every play (the down side, editing after the game, there are hundreds and hundreds of pictures to delete).I've recently learned that the best way to photograph football, or most fast action sports, is to use manual exposure settings (it makes sense, the lighting doesn't change much). This camera has a very easy to read gauge at the bottom of the viewfinder that indicates +/- EV to what the meter would have set. This feature is absolutely indispensible for manual settings - no silly flashing, just a nice analog meter at the bottom.This camera focuses faster than anything I have ever seen. There seems to be focus rectangles all over the screen. Whenever focus is achieved, even in servo (or follow focus) mode, the rectangle flashes black in daylight, and red in low light. The servo seems to track a focused object better than I've seen in previous cameras.If you have a Canon 580EX II flash, this thing controls that flash perfectly. There's no need for that stinking sixty dollar off camera cord. There are more modes to control the flash than I could ever imagine using off camera: include the on camera flash, don't include the on camera flash, set ratios between the two flashes, add A and B flashes, control the ratios of all the flashes. The settings are somewhat buried in a menu, but once set, they do exactly what you need. Placing a 580 in a softbox or an umbrella is a piece of cake - zero cabling. I love this function.The kit lens is surprisingly good. This is not the same piece of junk that Canon packages with the Rebel Digital line. The lens is hefty. The front element does not rotate during zoom or focus, a huge bonus. To me the jury is still out on Image Stabilizing (IS) for this lens. I wasn't very impressed with how it worked for football photography. Sadly, I'm comparing it to a four thousand dollar lens, and that isn't fair at all.My one single complaint with this camera is the viewfinder. I wear glasses and it is has taken a bit of getting used to aligning myself to the viewfinder. There isn't quite as much eye relief as I'd like. It is a minor adjustment I'm making. I was also struck by how the viewfinder isn't as bright as on other cameras. Nothing terribly or disturbing, just about one stop dimmer than other cameras I've used. On the other hand, the vertical and horizontal grids are fantastic - no more rotating all my pictures 2 degrees because I tilt the camera that direction.But WAIT THERE's MORE! The video on this camera is everything in the world you have read about. I have totally died and gone to heaven over that mode. I love film and movies more than anyone. I've dreamt about making my own films, and have been so frustrated with video cameras. I never realized it was depth of field that ruins video cameras, or gives them away. You've seen the sample films professionals have shot with the 5D Mark II, they are very film like. Well the 7D shoots exactly the same kind of film (um video).Now there are a few gotchas with the video. This isn't a camcorder, so grabbing it, hoping for autofocus and crazy zoom with buttons, isn't going to happen. You really have to think before you press the stop start button. Live view takes a very long time to achieve focus (you have to do that before filming). Any focusing you do during shooting has to be done manually, so you better know your distances because you cannot set focus from the live view screen. Zoom is mostly out of the question because the zoom ring is simply not smooth enough on the kit lens to get a fluid zoom. In order to follow focus and zoom, you will have to buy some very expensive motors to attach to this camera (that is what the professionals have done to make all those videos you've seen). On the other hand, if you plan the shot carefully, avoid zooming and changes in focus plane - this is the most incredible video camera every built. The first day I owned this camera, I stepped outside, focused on a waving American flag, and started recording. This was the most beautiful piece of 15 second video I had ever captured. The flag is in perfect focus right at the pole with beautifully blurred trees in the background.Sound for video is also a bit complicated. The built in microphone captures MONO sound only. It is not a bad microphone, but be prepared for a ton of wind noise if there is even a breeze. Frankly, there is no other way to capture sound than to use an external recording device with microphones, or buy attachment microphones that sit on the hot shoe. But even with external microphones, the camera still does dynamic level setting (no way to over ride that setting) and can create some very bad recording levels.On the video front, if you want to recreate those gorgeous videos you've seen on Vimeo, you'll need two very expensive motor drives for zoom and focus, a really great fluid head tripod, and an external audio recording device. The video captured is nothing short of incredible.Is the 5D Mark II worth the extra money? I think the fundamental difference is full frame 35mm on the 5D versus APS-C sensor on the 7D. For my money, I think you hit diminishing marginal returns on the 5D, I'd rather spend the extra money on lenses or flashes. I have not touched a 60D yet. The reviews have been excellent. I think there are a few compromises compared to the 7D that I didn't want to give up for the price difference, slower frames per second, (no off camera flash control - edit, the 60D does have this control), different body construction, and I'm not a fan of the flip LCD screen.I've fallen back in love with an SLR camera. Canon built an incredible winner with this camera.","09 27, 2010",A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,Daniel G.

Before I even start my review, let me point out although this camera looks like a DSLR and has some DSLR features and controls, it is not a DSLR. It is basically a ""point and shoot"" with a fairly small 1/2"" sensor, inside a DSLR style body, with an incredible zoom lens. Now that I got that out of the way, on to the review. Unboxing the HS50EXR, the first thing I noticed was the size and weight of the camera. I have several other super-zooms, and this is by far the biggest and heaviest. It's not quite as heavy and big as a DSLR, but it's close. In my hands, the cameras has good ergonomics, and feels well built. Controls are fairly well laid out too. After charging the proprietary battery, which took about 2 hours in the included external charger, I noticed my first disappointment. The plastic battery door does not seem that well made and designed. It feels cheap and I question how long it will last. My next disappointment was the all plastic tripod mount. I then installed the lens cap, neck strap, and lens hood. All seem about average quality. There is no SD card included,  so make sure you have one. A fast Class 10 is recommended. After turning the camera on, setting it up for how I wanted to shoot was quick and painless. Having some experience with an earlier Fuji EXR camera helped me decided how I was going to shoot. If you've never used a Fuji EXR camera, there is a learning curve to get the best results. It's not as easy to accomplish as others I've used. I set out on a bright sunny day, and took over a hundred pictures under various conditions. I used several different modes (this camrea has many) and settings. I shot mostly in EXR High Resolution Mode,(P)Mode, and simple auto mode. I use Fine/JPEG Format, not RAW. Refresh time between shots was almost instant, and the fastest of any similar camera I own. The manual zoom lens was a pleasure to use. It's incredible 24-1000mm range didn't disappoint. It isn't quite as smooth as a DSLR manual zoom lens, but I didn't expect it to be. The 3"", high resolution articulating screen also didn't disappoint. It's is clear and bright. While out, I also took several minutes of video to evaluate later. When I got home, I also shot a few dozen indoor pictures for testing purposes. I shot most of them in simple auto mode to see how the camera would handle low light without any help. After shooting about 200 pictures and several minutes of video, my battery still shows as full which tells me battery life is excellent.When I finished my testing, I hooked the camera up to my PC and HD Monitor using the included USB cable. Thankfully, the cable is standard and not proprietary. Once downloaded, my results didn't disappoint. Almost all my outdoor pictures came out excellent no matter what mode I used. Details were great. Colors were accurate. I didn't notice any optical aberrations, etc. The Fuji's Image Stabilization did a great job at the high end of the zoom. I used ""continuous mode"". One other setting that seemed to have slightly better results was turning the NR down to ""low"". All my other settings were the camera's defaults. The results were easily as good as my old Lumix FZ35, the super-zoom I considered the best for image quality until now. My indoor results were very good too. Image noise was low up until ISO 400, and still acceptable at ISO 800. I have no doubt that with a little tweaking of the camera's settings, my results could be even better. My HD test video came out excellent too. It did not disappoint on my HD monitor.The Fujifilm FinePix HS50EXR is not a DSLR, and it isn't perfect. It is a great camera with an incredible lens though. With a little trial and error, it produces pictures as good as any bridge camera I own. I recommend it.Pros:Incredible 42x Wide Angle Manual Zoom Lens.3"" High Resolution Articulating ScreenElectronic Viewfinder.Good automatic modes.Manual controls.RAW Mode.Excellent image quality indoors and out.Excellent 1080p HD video quality.Super fast focusing and refresh time between shots.Great battery life.Cons:Fairly expensive.EXR settings have a learning curve.Poor battery cover and tripod mount.Mediocre accessories.Proprietary battery.Larger and heavier than most bridge cameras.","04 22, 2013",A2UOHALGF2X77Q,D.

I bought this lens from Amazon (great transaction, even when sent to the address of a customer where I was working) for use with my 7D and 40D cameras.  Well, the 40D didn't last very long.  It rolled over and died for the 2nd or third time while I was shooting on the Bonneville salt flats.  Good thing I'd just bought a 5D body.  Or is it?First, the good stuff.  I bought this lens to replace a Canon 18-200mm EF-S zoom (buying that lens was a big mistake on my part.)  I found it to be very soft, full of barrel distortion and it failed multiple times.  Somewhere there's a review that I wrote which states, ""Avoid this like the plague.""  I stand by that recommendation.Nonetheless, I did a lot of checking, review reading and other research before buying the Tamron lens.  Yes, I could have bought a Canon L 17-40, but all the reviews I read said that the Tamron was a sharper lens.  I can't argue about that.  I'm very pleased with Tamron's build quality (it didn't break the lens lock the second time I used it like the Canon and it didn't have the internal barrel rails come loose after a year like said Canon lens.  I'm also very happy with the image quality, particularly with macro shots.  It wins hands down over the Canon 18-200.  Yes, I had to send it into Tamron for service once, but since then, no trouble.  And a 6 year warranty is just plain outstanding.I just kept it on my 7D until I got to the salt flats in August.  Then it was necessary to start switching around: 70-200 L, 100-400 L and the Tamron...even the Canon cheapie 50mm f1.8 EF-S lens.  Things worked fine until my 40D backup rolled over and died for the 3rd time.  I found myself in a position to buy a 5D Mk I that had just been rebuilt by the factory and, while it's slow and a little clunky...sorta like a 30D, it works fine for close-to-medium length shots.  Like panning to follow a race car at 400 mph.  The FPS rate is just too slow.  So I moved all my high-speed stuff over to the 7D and I'm pleased with the results.  But what lens to use on the 5D?  The 50mm prime and the Tamron 17-50 both caused vignetting with the full-frame 5D.  And at the same time, the Tamron lens croaked.  So I pulled out my ""hardly ever used 28-135 IS EF-S"" that had been the kit lens for my 40D when I bought it.  I found it to be not wide enough for my use with a crop sensor, but when it was introduced to the 5D, it was like a marriage made in heaven.  It felt right.  It covers a good focal length range.  It has IS and is sharper in macro use by orders of magnitude over the 18-200.  (Yeah, I know, it has too long a focal length range to be practical at EF-S pricing.)So with the 28-135 on the 5D, I needed a wide-tele lens for the 7D.  This is where the Tamron shines.  After a trip back to the mother ship for repairs, it works perfectly with the ASC sensor, provides very sharp images and the f2.8 aperture is great, but I hardly ever use it, choosing a smaller aperture for increased depth of field.  And it works very nicely with the built-in flash on the 7D.Here comes the wrap-up:Pros:Price.  Not horribly expensive, but not a cheapie, either.  Seems to be priced right for what it is.Sharpness. Wery sharp images, no barrel distortion nor lens flares that I've been able to find yet.  (I've used it for a whole season on the salt flats, and did a lotta shots with it, as well as car shows and incidental photography.)Aperture.  F2.8 is very nice.Weight.  Pretty light for the quality of the lens.  Feels fine on the camera, especially with the battery pack.Overall quality.  Again, after the trip to Tamron for warranty service, it's been very good.Cons:Crop sensor only:  I wish I could use it on my 5D, but I'll make do with the 28-135.  If I really feel the need, I can buy a Canon 17-40 L, but I don't think I need one at this time.The zoom ring rotates in the opposite direction from what I'm used to.  Since I've never used Nikon equipment, maybe it's right for them.  Minor complaint, but if it hadn't been for this, I would have given it 5 stars.No IS (VR).  Picky, picky picky.  At the short focal length, IS isn't a big deal.  I shoot automotive subjects, not insects at twilight, so I've never run into a problem here.  If I find a need for available light shots, I have tripods I can use.Noise.  The focusing motor is louder than some other lenses I've used.  But when shooting race cars, it's not much of an issue.  The camera's shutter is louder than the lens.Hope this is helpful.","10 31, 2012",A3JO106IYW3BAW,Ray the Rat,54.0,"Only good for ASC or ""crop"" sensor cameras",12.0,386.0,1351641600.0,923.0,19.8239923815,9.90180507541,9.9221873061,0.151228155,0.0,0.873123309183

I seldom use the viewfinder and instead tend to use the high contrast and very sharp monitor built into the camera. Focus is quick and accurate with the kit lens. Pictures are bright and color is very accurate.Vibration Reduction is better than I expected. With the camera on my tripod and VR off, I can tap the tripod and see the image resonate with the vibration in the tripod. With VR on, there is no discernable shake even with the 70-300mm lens on full zoom. Quite amazing actually. I can hear the VR mechanism working but it's not loud, just quietly working it's magic.With AF and VR on, it takes a second to take an image since everything has to stabilize before the picture is taken. Turning them off and doing manual focus allows a much faster process per picture.I also purchased a Tamron 70-300mm lens and all features work perfectly with this camera, both AF and VR (which Tamron calls VC) work pretty much the same on it and the kit lens.It's worth every penny. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat. This camera makes ME smile.1 Month Update: (June 27)We have a couple of thousand shots out of this amazing camera now.About 1500 images out in nature with the 300mm zoom all the way out capturing birds in flight, nesting and doing what birds do. Sure we throw a lot of them out. Every photographer does. The image is good, it's just not of anything worth keeping. This is not a camera problem. This is a photographer problem. Using the camera more is the answer.In the last two weeks, we've experimented with an older fully manual 55mm Micro-Nikkor-P lens with the 27.5mm extension tube. It takes a little experimentation to get the exposure but the images are exquisite. I never expected to be able to put a 40 year old Nikon lens on this camera but I did and with the camera set to manual you can use this ultra modern camera very similarly to how we took pictures 40 years ago. The manufacturing quality of those old lenses is amazing. There are tens of thousands of them on the used market and available relatively inexpensively. I have just over $100 in the used macro lens and extension tube and that gives us 2:1, 1:1 to .5:1 macro ability with a focal distance measured in inches out to infinity. The Micro-Nikkor lenses have legendary Nikon quality and performance and it's not at all lost on this camera.If you've always wanted to get those close up macro shots of bugs or flowers breaking into bloom, don't shy away from those old Nikkor lenses in manual mode. They take wonderful pictures with the D5100.As a bonus, my wife wasn't really solid with learning the relationship between shutter speed, f stop and ISO until a week with the manual lens on. Now she's all over it. Because you HAVE TO LEARN to make it work at all. Depth of field now makes sense to her and now she knows how to achieve it. Or not.3 Month Update: (August 3)Just shot a wedding in Duluth and the north shore of Lake Superior. (not as the paid photographer) Two days, rehearsal, rehearsal dinner campfire/cabin, wedding and reception. Took 430 shots. Left the camera on automatic 99% of the time. About 20 shots were really great photos. About 15 of them were motion blurred, badly focused or missed target. The rest of them were acceptable shots. Nearly all of the motion blurred were from the Tamron 70-300 in full zoom. Half of those, the subject moved in the frame.Overall I'd rate it a success. Two of the photos were real winners. Pictures that told a story and caught emotion.I can't fault the camera or lenses for anything. They just worked. Very happy with the setup.I had an external flash on, the Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight. I also had the diffuser for it from Stofen, the OM-400. This flash was really not up to the task for a big room like a church. Thankfully the room was well lit. For smaller rooms around 30 x 20 or less, the flash and diffuser was excellent. The room really needs a white ceiling for the diffuser to work properly since it directs a lot of light up at a 45 degree angle. I took nearly all of the church interior pictures hand held with no flash and let the VR lenses do their magic. I got a lot of good shots from the balcony with the 70-300 lens and the camera balanced on the railing.Outdoor pictures near dusk in low outdoor lighting came out way better than any camera I've had in the past. Until it got dark enough to simply not support picture taking, the dusk pictures pretty much look like the daytime pictures. The D5100 really is amazing in low light conditions.Battery life was very good. I went through two batteries in the camera. I'm sure the external flash helped battery life. I can't speak to battery life in the flash since I recharged them once that night and can't tell how far they were run down. The flash always recharged VERY quickly.Wrap Up:Cameras take images. Photographers take pictures. The Nikon D5100 is way more capable than most of us. I have yet to demand something from it that it hasn't delivered with excellence. With this much capability, we can work on and improve our abilities. And with digital images being micro-pennies vs dollars in old school terms, it's an inexpensive way to get an education in photography.And you're going to end up with some great pictures in the process.Get it.","05 21, 2012",A22G0HMYN6JQ3M,PRB,58.0,Bought for Birding,6.0,459.0,1337558400.0,1026.0,56.4699397614,27.6403414293,28.8295983321,0.0523951108284,0.0,0.873197365831

The finish and balance of the camera are excellent and - for the most part - it's a joy to use.This is Sony's 8th NEX camera in just over two years. You can't say that they aren't serious about the camera line. The NEX 6 is an enthusiast's camera. It's for photographers who are looking for more manual controls than are available in the NEX 3 or 5 models. It has a similar 16 MP sensor to the others and the same very good image quality. You aren't gaining better picture quality in getting the 6 vs one of the NEX 3 or 5 models. So if you are moving up from a phone camera or a point and shoot, you might find one of the other models closer to what you are used to than the NEX 6.On the other hand, if you are looking at the NEX 6 as second camera, or even as a replacement for a bigger one, the 6 is much more portable than a DSLR the extra dials and buttons on the NEX 6 will speed up camera mode and exposure changes. So, on to the specificsThe first yes is the inclusion of an electronic viewfinder (EVF), similar to the one in the NEX 7. That's a great inclusion and makes the 6 more versatile. It's seems similar to the NEX 7 EVF and the same pixel dimension. The EVF is sharp and clear. It works well on this size camera.The second yes is the addition of a flash shoe, a real one that accepts all sorts of manual flashes. It's a change from the old reversed Minolta/Sony flash shoe, so if you have old Sony flashes you will need an adaptor. The newest Sony flashes are built the new flash shoe. The camera also has a built in flash, instead of the screw on model on my old NEX 5n. Flash sync is a slow 1/160, which a bit disappointing but at least the camera will now support more flashes and off camera flash.The third and fourth yeses encompass the inclusion of a mode dial and a camera top control dial. These aren't the same as the NEX 7 dials but will be immediately familiar to experienced camera users. The control dial and the mode dial are stacked on the same spindle. I wasn't sure how that would work, but in practice, just fine. The only thing I would have like to have added is the ability to use the back panel control dial for more functions, like exposure compensation in A or S modes. That's not currently possible and can't be customized. This may change with a firmware update. My fingers are crossed. Sony still includes the some very helpful camera modes like sweep panorama and hand held twilight, along with a bunch of others. The inclusion of a mode dial makes accessing these faster and easiser.The fifth yes is the new position for the movie button. The button on my NEX 5n is where I often push it accidentally. In fact, I seldom spent more than a half hour shooting without accidentally starting a movie. The button on the NEX 7 is even easier to mistakenly activate. The problem on the 7 is so bad that Sony made a software update to deactivate the movie button entirely. On the 6, Sony has simply moved the button to a location where your right thumb won't rest naturally on it. The movie button is a little awkward to use now, but not too much so.The meh, is the new lens. Oh, it's an improvement over the old kit lens, mostly. The size is perfect for a NEX camera. The lens looks great and when it's closed nobody will remark that you look like you have a lens with a little bit of camera behind it. Build quality is good. Finish is good, However, this is not the high optical quality kit lens for the NEX 7 that many of us have wanted. It's decently sharp for a kit lens, but it's still a kit lens and it has a kit lens' slow aperture.Sony still includes the some very helpful modes like sweep panorama and hand held twilight, along with a bunch of others. The inclusion of a mode dial makes accessing these faster and easiser.On the down side focus is a bit slower than with the old kit lens. Sony has done some sort of magic with the NEX 6 sensor that's supposed to make it focus more quickly. That may be so, but it's not my experience. When I place the NEX 6 and the NEX 5n side by side in tripods and activated the shutter button, the camera with the old kit lens generally reached focus more quickly than the one with the new lens. This isn't a scientific test with instruments, but the new lens didn't wow me with it's focus speed. My other problem with the new lens is that it has a zoom motor instead of direct gearing for zoom. I guess that this is a requirement of the collapsing lens and it's compactness. The lens doesn't have the tactile feedback of a non-motorized lens. It's also a bit slower to zoom. On the plus side, zooming is smoother during movie shooting. Also the new lens seems to provide a bit more shake control than the old kit lens while shooting movies. For stills, they are both good.The huh is for Sony eliminating the touch screen on the NEX 6. Sony seems to think that more serious photographers won't want a touch screen. I do. Still, I can somewhat see their point. What's brain dead, though, is adding apps to the camera that you can't interact with on the screen. Duh. It's like stepping back from using a new iPhone and having to navigate through an old fashioned dumb phone. Yes, you have to use buttons and the back control wheel to get around in the app interfaces. Talk about user unfriendly. Still, I got a camera, not a micro tablet. I can see some real potential in camera apps, especially with built in Wi-Fi that allows you to control your camera from your phone or tablet. They just won't be as easy to use with the NEX 6.The NEX 6 is an excellent camera, though it costs more than some DSLRs. My biggest problem with recommending it is the limited line of NEX lenses. Sony hasn't gotten the idea that cameras are no better than their lenses. There are about as many Sony NEX camera models as Sony lenses for them. That's the main reason, other than price, why I'm only giving 4 stars. On the other hand, third party lens makers are now making NEX lenses and Zeiss has promised some autofocus NEX lenses in '13. There's also the fact that Sony's focus peaking makes manual focusing very easy and adaptors allow you to put almost any kind of APS or full frame lens on a NEX camera. So this is a good camera that faces good competition. I like it because it feel right in my hands, takes great photos and is small and light.","11 6, 2012",A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ,"Michael McKee ""mystic cowboy""",69.0,Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Meh...

So, as an owner of the device, would I also consider it ""magical"" and ""revolutionary""?Well, I don't know about magical as I generally reserve that for unicorns and the like. I've logged several hours on the device since launch day to give you a well-rounded account of the great, the not so great, and hopefully help you know if the iPad is right for you!--Overview:I really love my iPad. Like many, my first impression was that it was just a giant iPod Touch. I've come to realize that's not the case. In fact, it's so much more useful than an iPod Touch, I just chuckle these days when people say this. For me, the applications, utilization of the extra space, and the web capabilities that really won me over. There are a few features I'm really hoping are forthcoming in a future software build that would make the device even more useful. On the whole, the iPad has become an extremely useful device that's got my laptop feeling a bit unloved and jealous these days.--Hardware:There's no denying the iPad is gorgeous. Apple has re-envisioned the beautiful look of the iPod Touch/iPhone in a fuller form. The screen is flawless and (as I unfortunately learned) very resistant to scratching. If you intend to use the device outdoors you'll want to know that the high-gloss on the screen makes it very difficult to see in direct sunlight at times. The speaker and mic are great in this device. The speaker will fill an entire room with sound. Unfortunately, Apple (yet again) put a focus on design over ergonomic. The iPad is a bit hefty, and a bit difficult to hold for long periods of time. It is; however, much sturdier than you might expect from the pictures.The processor works extremely well with the iPhone OS, it's a screaming combination that makes this one of the fastest tablet computers I've used in ages. That being said, much of the software is designed for the less powerful iPhone still. We'll see how the iPad's speed stands up to a new wave of software designed for 1GHz mobile processors soon enough. Initially; however, it's been unimaginably quick.Battery life is amazing. I'm getting at least 8 hours (even watching video) and sometimes more. I also opted for the 64GB version of the iPad. It has plenty of storage for what I've been using the device for, but as my video collection becomes progressively more High Definition, it won't be long before I have to start picking and choosing what I can place on my iPad. This is not something I'm happy about in a device costing $699 + Tax that's so clearly designed for HD video and content. I'm also very disappointed in Apple's decision to not include an SD card reader for the device. This is one area where the HP slate still has a compelling advantage. There are many instances in which, popping in an SD card and being able to access the documents, images, music, and video stored on it would be extremely nice. Apple has planned an accessory for the iPad which will allow you to port your photos to it via an SD card adapter, but that's the extent of its functionality with SD cards. That's a definite delta for me.I have the Wi-Fi edition as the 3G version has not been released yet. I've run into a few instances where it would have been extremely nice to have 3G connectivity. If I had to make the choice over again, I think I would question my decision that everywhere I go has Wi-Fi anyway, and probably wait for the 3G edition. I'd really encourage you to hold out if you think there's any way in which you'd use the iPad regularly outside of Wi-Fi coverage.Just a quick note, I've had none of the issues that other users have reported with wireless connectivity. My iPad has been drama-free thus far. I'll update this review as I encounter issues to keep you aware.--Web Browsing & EmailTwo of the iPad's strongest features are web browsing and email. Safari (the iPhone OS' native browser) is very fast. It's a significantly better browsing experience on the iPad than you'll have on the iPhone. I've found that I really don't use apps for sites like Facebook anymore. The iPad's screen makes it much easier to just visit the actual Facebook site.Even on the iPhone, email has never been so quick and simple. Apple really devised a great approach to email. A quick tap calls up a pain showing you all the emails in your inbox with a brief preview. You can organize, clear, or open email in ways that seem decades ahead of what MS Outlook is capable of. Setting up my Corporate Exchange account on the iPad took less than 60 seconds! It's hard to express what makes email so much better on the iPad than the iPhone/iPod Touch, but you'll know it when you see it.--The ApplicationsThe applications really sold me on the iPad. I can't say enough about the iWork suite (sold separately via the App Store)! This software suite puts a desktop-grade word processing application and presentation software on your iPad. The ""Numbers"" spreadsheet application isn't exactly as smooth, but is still the best spreadsheet app available on a mobile platform. There are just so many great applications already available for the iPad that I can't list them all. My favorites so far are iWork Suite, Sketchbook Pro, Kindle for iPad, ABC Player, and Marvel Comics App. The extra screen real estate makes this device unquestionably better for media. Even the iPod application within the iPad is much smoother than on other iPhone OS devices. The iPad will also run your iPhone applications, and can double their size to help them fill more of the gigantic screen. Honestly, the iPhone applications aren't much of a selling point on this device. They look grainy and ridiculous on the iPad's screen.--iBook Store/ReaderThe iPad does several things well. One it doesn't do well would be eBooks. The backlit screen is tough on the eyes and the resolution leaves the characters fuzzy. As a Kindle owner, I can honestly say that the iPad is not a replacement for that device. This is pretty much universally true of the eReader applications available for the iPhone/iPad. It may be personal preference but I really don't enjoy more than brief periods of reading on backlit screens. There's a reason 700 page novels aren't backlit = ).--I really wish it had...I really wish Apple would reconsider their stance on Adobe Flash. The absence of the key internet video technology makes the internet a little hit or miss. You'll still have a great YouTube option via the iPad's YouTube app, but little embedded videos on places like the NYT, MSNBC, or other sites are just not there at this point. Let's hope that Adobe and Apple either make up soon or HTML5 catches on extremely fast! Until then, the HP Slate may be a better option for users who really take advantage of web video other than YouTube.A camera would also be really nice, especially a front-facing camera for video conferencing. In a dock the iPad seems almost born to video conference! I doubt I'd be taking many pictures with my iPad if it included just a standard back-mounted camera, but it might help developers do more in their applications.--The Accessories:The iPad uses the same (30-pin) style connector as the iPhone/iPod so it already has a wealth of compatible accessories on the market. If you own an iPhone/iPod, it may even be compatible with devices you already own. Here's the rule of thumb: If you have to dock the iPhone/iPod Touch... the iPad won't be compatible, if you can connect it via a cable, it'll work. This is mostly due to the considerable size of the iPad. Obviously, it's not going to fit in that smaller indentation that most iPhone/iPod docks utilize.I really recommend a case, and dock for this beast. I've owned my iPhone for 3 years and never owned a case for it (until a few weeks ago). I got away with that just fine. The larger screen of the iPad makes it a different sort of device; however, and I wouldn't even think of running around without a case on this thing. It's actually a bit disappointing that Apple didn't include one. I'm sort of glad they didn't; however, because I purchased the iPad case designed by Apple and was extremely disappointed. It's of a very weak felt lined cardboard from what I can tell. Its material holds oil and lint making the screen worse when you close the case. It also has such a tight grip on the device that putting the iPad in or taking it out of the case makes you feel like you might damage it.The iPad really needs a dock! You wouldn't really anticipate it, but having this giant on your counter can really occupy much of your kitchen or desk space. I'd recommend a dock as they generally hold the device upright maximizing the space around it. Apple makes a really great dock for the device that includes an audio-out port. Just note, that the case designed by Apple isn't compatible with the dock. Go figure.If you intend to carry a lot of video on the device, you may also want to invest in a video-out cable. The solutions available for the iPhone/iPod Touch will work for the iPad, or you can opt for the Apple video out cables (they actually aren't too horrible price-wise).--A note about iPhone OS 4:Apple announced the newest edition of the iPhone operating system (which the iPad runs on) last week. Some really great features are on their way that will benefit the iPad a great deal! Amongst the best of them- multi-tasking (run multiple applications or processes at once), geotagging, improvements to gaming on the device, and more! Read up on the new OS! It should be available for the iPad later this year.Thanks for reading my review! I hope it helped. If you do decide to purchase an iPad, have fun. It's a great device, and don't forget to try out the Sketchbook Pro, and iWork apps. I really love them on mine!","04 11, 2010",A1OI9O2S4UOB5O,"JL ""J""",91.0,Considering the iPad,20.0,653.0,1270944000.0,1848.0,66.4401395814,33.3452209892,33.0949185922,0.0452672614172,0.0,0.872722240122

Previously, I spent several years with the x0D line of Canons, most recently the 50D, so this new model represents a substantial upgrade in terms of raw capabilities. Other reviewers have extensively discussed the many aspects of the 5DIII's overall handling, so I'll refrain from being repetitive.Upon taking the camera from the box, I excitedly placed a lens on the camera, turned it to my window and looked through the viewfinder. I was utterly dismayed. The view was dim and unfocused. I turned the focus ring of the lens to no avail. Something must be askew within the camera, I thought. I removed the lens, placed it on my 50D to be sure that it wasn't the lens. It wasn't. This wasn't good. To make a long story short, it turns out that the battery is necessary even with the camera turned off just to look through the viewfinder. With a charged battery in place, the image brightens and can easily be brought into focus. I've yet to see any discussion of this online and there is only a brief statement buried within the hundreds of pages of owner's manual; perhaps this is unchanged from the 5DII, but it sure represents a big difference from my old 50D. So - Step 1 - charge your battery and install it, then begin your exploration of the camera.My second issue came with my installation of Canon's software from their DVD onto my Mac Pro, on which I was running OS 10.6.8. I couldn't install the software. The installer would bounce once, then stop running, and that was the end of that. I had no problem installing the software on my laptop running Lion, or on an iMac running Lion, so I figured the software simply wouldn't work under 10.6.8. I bit the bullet and upgraded my Mac Pro to 10.7, only to find that the Canon software still wouldn't install, even after booting in Safe Mode. After several back-and-forth discussions with Canon Support, they suggested that I try logging in to my Mac Pro as a different user. I created a new Administrator that would have access to my applications folder, and behold, the software installed properly. I then needed to download several software upgrades from Canon, move those to the new user account, and install those, as they too would not work with my own account. I've never had a problem with Canon software installers and still have not found an explanation as to what's wrong or how to fix it. Canon stuck with me, though, until I got the workaround working. Some people asked me why I was bothering with Canon's software, given Lightroom, Aperture, Photoshop, and so forth. There are some aspects of Canon's software, however, that make certain activities easier. I like it for quick use of stitching photos together as well as for upgrading firmware in the camera. Your mileage may vary.Now I had camera operational and software installed. I installed two cards: the Lexar Professional 400x 128 GB SDXC UHS-I Card and the Lexar Professional 128 GB 400x UDMA7 CompactFlash Card. Both quickly formatted and have worked flawlessly since. I appear to have a impressive amount of storage room for raw photos and at least a sufficient amount of space for video, which I admit I have yet to explore. I've noticed a few things over the past weeks:1) The lack of a built-in flash is an improvement. I often found that my 50D would suddenly pop up its flash attachment when I least expected it. Yes, of course there are workarounds to that, and I used them at times when I really didn't want the flash to be used. But outside in the middle of the day, I wouldn't expect the flash unit to open up and hadn't bothered with the workaround. In any case, I greatly prefer the 5DIII's approach of simply adjusting the ISO to fit the need if I'm running in automatic mode (and sometimes I do). I'm more than happy to grab my flash unit if I want to take flash pictures. Maybe it's because I trained with a Contax II and was limited to occasional use of a heavy flash attachment and Press 40 flashbulbs that I find myself being perfectly comfortable without a flash, but I truly feel that this leaves the choice of flash/no-flash to me every time without my having to give it a second thought.2) Never once in years of use did my mode dial turn by itself. I see no need for a locking mode dial and find it a very minor annoyance, particularly when my hands are full while trying to take photos in active situations.3) I'm not particularly comfortable with the interface of the enlarge button. With the x0D, you push the button repetitively to get to the level of enlargement desired on the screen. With the 5DIII, you push it once, then use the dial to adjust the level of enlargement. Pushing the button a second time simply returns you to the full image. The number of steps hasn't changed, but the need to move from button to dial has been added. I'm not clear as to why that added step is now necessary.4) This part IS repetitive - low light photos are impressive. With a Canon EF 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 DO IS lens, set to 300mm, I took a photo of the moon, adjusted the exposure by several stops to correct the overexposure, then again shot a photograph. Handheld. At ISO 12,800. And the photo looks good. Taking pictures in a dark room by the light of an iPad, or by the flickering light of a TV, or by candlelight - all possible while retaining the mood, with minimal noise, and without need of a tripod. And again, having grown up with ASA 25 Kodachrome and having had the thrill of occasionally pushing Tri-X beyond its ASA 400 baseline capability, this truly is a whole new world.5) I do miss the ability to replace the focusing screen, as I always did in the 0xD line. I miss ground glass, and I really miss split-prisms. The 5DIII viewfinder is ALMOST as good as the viewfinder in my Pentax Super Program. It IS as bright and very nearly as large, but I really can't manually focus without the proper tools in a film-based SLR. The KatzEye or equivalent split-prism focus screens come close (though lacking the ground glass), but now I'm totally reliant on autofocus. So far, the 5DIII hasn't let me down in that respect, and is far better than my 50D was in low light or low contrast situations. But I'd jump ship in a moment if a competitor came out with a similar camera that had a viewfinder like those from my Pentax days.Overall, I've been thrilled with the first few ""rolls"" of photos that I've taken with the 5DIII. The camera feels right in my hand - a marked improvement from the 50D. The little rubber doors for the USB port open and close with ease, moving out of the way for cabling as needed in a manner superior to that of the 50D. And I'm working my way through the hefty manual without too much difficulty. There are complexities here that the pro photographers will love, and there's an ease present that will allow those of us who enjoy photography to occasionally just point-and-shoot without missing too much.","05 15, 2012",A3JUHP1E3WUHEA,Dr. Stuart Gitlow,59.0,50D to 5D Mark III,12.0,560.0,1337040000.0,1312.0,67.0308072567,34.4776700513,32.5531372054,0.0456375189293,0.0,0.873073691974

I just updated my review to downgrade to 2 stars. The router stopped working last night - just 7 months after I got it and configured it. It can no longer get an IP address from my internet provider, Comcast. My computers could still connect to it wirelessly and the DHCP server seemed to work still, but what good is any of that without an internet connection? After hours of trying to fix it - including updating the firmware and resetting it to the factory defaults - I finally gave up and set my old router back up.**Original Review**With more and more of our devices integrating with our wireless networks, a wireless router is evolved from a luxury or novelty item to a thing of necessity in most households. This multi-device reliance on wireless makes a stable network an absolute must.The Linksys EA4500 App-Enabled N900 Dual-Band Wireless-N Router with Gigabit and USB promises much and so far, I find it delivers. I upgraded to this router from aCisco-Linksys E4200 Dual-Band Wireless-N Router, and already see a performance improvement in several areas. For instance, my TiVo Premieres now have a feature that allows me to stream recordings from one to the other if they are both connected to my network. With the old router, I could transfer the programs between TiVos over the network, but streaming never worked. I actually thought this was a problem on the TiVo side until I installed the EA4500 router and found the problem resolved. I can now stream without any buffering issues between those two TiVos.But I'm getting ahead of myself... First, the setup. As with all of the Cisco/Linksys SOHO routers in the last few years, the router has a setup disk that does the heavy lifting for you. Before connecting the new router, you insert the disk into a computer and follow the instructions as it walks you through each step, complete with pictures and text instruction. One of the first steps is to check to see if there are any updates to the Cisco Connect software that configures and manages the router. This process took quite a long time, I thought, although I'm on Comcast/Xfinity's fast internet. At one point, I worried that it was hung, but it finally did finish. I would say it took approximately 30 minutes for the update check and download. Once that part completed, the rest of the configuration proceeded much more quickly.Once it finished, I found that I could not connect to the internet. My desktop PC was connected to the EA4500 via Ethernet cable and was not the issue. After I entered the Advanced Configuration in a web browser and went through each node, I found that Cisco Connect had assumed I needed to clone my computer's MAC address and had enabled that setting. I already happen to know that my Comcast internet service does not need to do that, so I disabled the MAC address cloning setting, rebooted the modem and router for good measure, and found that fixed it. Running a test of the internet speeds using the Cisco Connect utility showed I was receiving more than 20 Mbps download speed and close to 5 Mbps upload speed. Needless to say, I was very pleased.With the internet issue resolved, the next task was to enter the special configurations I needed for port forwarding, QoS (Quality of Service), etc.The QoS feature allows you to configure one or more devices with bandwidth allowances and restrictions. In my case, I want my Ooma Voice Over IP router to have priority over other devices in my network, so I entered its MAC address (a unique identifier for network devices) and gave it the highest priority. If you have devices you want to configure as a low priority, you can do this also.I use port forwarding to enable the FTP service on my NetGear ReadyNAS device to be accessed from outside of my home network. Port forwarding directs traffic for certain protocols and ports such as FTP to the IP address you've specified on your internal network. Once configured, I can navigate to the IP address Comcast gives my home FTP and the router knows to send that traffic to the ReadyNAS device. The port forwarding nodes are easy to configure, with several common protocols already pre-populated for you so that all you have to do is enable them and enter the IP address for the device in question. However, the EA4500 also offers more advanced configuration by allowing you to name and configure your own ports rather than using their pre-built options.If you do need to access any part of your network remotely, you will find tremendous advantage to configuring the DDNS feature, unless your ISP happens to assign you a static external IP address, which most do not for residential customers. What that means is your external IP address with your ISP is probably dynamic, or DHCP, and can be changed at any time without notice. Chances are your external IP address will stay the same most of the time even with DHCP, but the chance is still there it will change and it will always happen when you most need to get to something while outside your network. You can register for a DDNS address with several registrars and enter the configuration for your DDNS address in the Linksys router. The Linksys router stays in communication with the registrar and keeps it updated as to what your external IP address is currently. So instead of using your actual IP address, you simply point your web browser, ftp client, etc. to a textual address that you've set up at the DDNS registrar and they redirect that address to whatever your networks current IP is, like magic. I do use this feature, and found it works well in the EA4500.With a USB port on the back of the router, Linksys has enabled users to attach an external USB hard drive to the EA4500 and share the files and folders on that hard drive with users on your network. You can configure user IDs and passwords within the Advanced Configuration for the router and be as granular or as open with the access as suits your particular needs.There are four Gigabit Ethernet ports on the back of the router as well, and my desktop PCs network card is connecting at 1 Gigabit as does my Trendnet Switch. My other wired devices all have a maximum speed of 100 MB, but they connect very well also.But the heart of this device, and what most customers need it for, is its wireless capability. The Linksys EA4500 supports dual-band Wireless N, and I am happy to report that the wireless signal is much more stable in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands than its predecessor, the Linksys E4200. Where that old router's speeds within the 5 GHz spectrum jumped wildly on all the devices I had that support that band, all of my devices that use it stay solidly near or at the maximum speeds for their adapters with the EA4500. I have two Linksys USB adapters that support the 5 GHz range (AE1000 and AE2500) and both stay at 300 Mbps. My laptop's internal wireless card stays at 96 Mbps, which is the best I've ever seen it get and is why I use the Linksys AE2500 adapter on it instead). My Belkin adapter connects and remains at 155.5 Mbps. My netbook's internal wireless NIC remains reliably at 300 Mbps. At the end of this review, I have provided a full list of the network devices I currently use on my network in case any of you have the same device and need to know if they work well with this router.The router also includes a guest access feature, which is very common with today's routers. Guest Access allows you to configure a `separate' network from your main network. When you have guests over that need internet access, you can allow them to connect to the guest network. Guest access restricts them to internet only, and prevents them from being able to access any of the resources on your network such as shared files, etc. Be warned that guest access will also keep them from using wireless printers on your main network.The range for the wireless networks is great. There isn't a device in my house that isn't reporting Very Good or Excellent connectivity with it, no matter the location. Speedboost is supposed to increase signal strength across long distances so that you have better range and speed in your home. Having not found a weak spot in my home yet, I think this feature must be working well.As for security, this router offers several options that let you be as lax or as strict about security as you choose to be. Being in the IT industry myself, I am a stickler for security. I don't want anyone on my network unless I choose to allow them. One, I work from home often and as a Systems Engineer for a Systems Integration Company, I am subject to the regulations that my customers are and need to protect both their data and their networks from being compromised through my network or computers. I also don't want my own data comprised, but in addition to data security, I don't even want friendly neighbors hopping on without my permission. Comcast, as most ISPs do now, has a limit on how much bandwidth you can use each month. If you consistently go over that limit, then your service could be cancelled.To protect my network, I employee three security features: MAC Address Filtering, WPA2/WPA, and I hide my SSID (or network name) instead of visibly broadcasting it. While a determined and talented hacker might be able to break any one of these security features, the chances they'll break all of them are slim, and the average home user is probably not going to be targeted by a hacker of the caliber needed to do that.MAC Address Filtering lets you either allow all of the MAC Addresses that you have specified permission to access your network, or you can choose to deny specific MAC addresses access. The configuration for this is easy to do and works well.Hiding your SSID is also easy - just a quick radio button and save. This prevents users in range of your wireless router from even seeing it in their list of available networks. You can still configure it yourself by either manually entering the network name and other settings or using the WPA Setup button. You can also broadcast your network just long enough to get your devices configured easily, and then turn off the broadcasting afterwards.WPA or WPA2 is the encryption type most routers employ today and is much more secure than the old WEP encryption was. Cisco Connect will configure the router for WPA2/WPA by default, but you can configure the router to use an alternate encryption type if you need to.  Those options include WPA2/WPA, WPA2 Personal, WPA Personal, WPA2/WPA Enterprise Mixed Mode, WPA2 Enterprise, WPA Enterprise, or WEP. If you have older client network adapters in your network, it is likely they will not support any of the WPA or WPA2 options but will work with WEP. However, I highly recommend that you upgrade any WEP-only network cards with newer ones supporting WPA2/WPA for better security.I mentioned the Cisco Connect software before when I discussed the installation, but this utility is used for management of the router after the installation as well. The average home user will prefer to use Cisco Connect to do what they can as its wizard-based functions walk them through each option. More experienced users like me, however, will appreciate the Advanced Configuration available by accessing the router through a web browser.What I don't like about the Cisco Connect software is that it seems to need the admin password for the router to be the same as the network password. I might not necessarily want all users that need to access my network to have admin access. Even more of a security risk to me is the fact that the Cisco Connect software displays that password in its main screen, so anyone who has access to a PC with the Cisco Connect software for your router installed can easily get that password by launching the program. That said, in order to connect Cisco Connect to your router, you do have to run the installation from the Easy Setup Key that you create with Cisco Connect, so it isn't like anyone can download it from the Linksys website and point it to your router easily, although I'm certain someone determined and knowledgeable could find a way.As for the Easy Setup Key, it does allow for installation of the Cisco Connect software on other machines and it also allows for automated configuration of network adapters to connect to your network. You need a small USB key to create the Easy Setup Key and you will either be walked through it at the end of the initial setup or you can return to the Cisco Connect control panel to do this later.You can also configure clients for the wireless network using the Wi-Fi Protected Setup feature. If your client machine's network adapter supports that technology, you simply start the configuration on the client, press the Wi-Fi Protected Setup either on the back of the router or within the Advanced Configuration of the router using your web browser, and the two devices connect. No need to give the user your network password or have to manually enter settings, or even run the Easy Setup Key on that machine. I would recommend that this option be used for configuration of new client machines whenever possible to preserve the security of your passwords. It is important to note that you CAN disable the WPS feature in the Advanced Configuration should you need to.Most users will want this router because it is capable of Wireless N speeds, but this router does still support the b/g/n standards as well for backwards compatibility with older network adapters.I detailed some things I don't like about the Cisco Connect utility, but I should mention what I really do like. This tool has the ability to test download and upload speeds for your internet service between the router and the modem. This is a very good troubleshooting tool when you are trying to ferret out where your internet speed is being bogged down. By testing it on the router itself, you can easily determine if the issue warrants a call to your internet provider or if it is a problem within your own network.What home router would be complete without Parental Controls? This one allows you to limit specified computers from accessing certain website or you can even set up a schedule designating when a PC is allowed to use the internet. So, if you want to prevent the kids from browsing the world wide web until you are home from work, it is easy to set up.With the increasing presence of HD devices and media in our homes, streaming movies and shows, transferring videos over your network, all of it takes a toll because the HD file sizes are so much larger than standard definition. So far, my Roku has been able to stream HD shows from Amazon's video streaming service very well - not a single hiccup.This router also includes an option to use it as a DLNA media server. If you attach a USB hard drive to the router, you can specify a folder with supported media types like music files, movies, etc. Then you simply enable the Media Server option within the router so that devices on your network that support DLNA can access the supported files on the hard drive attached to your router. As more and more of our music and movies become digital, this is becoming a more important feature than ever.Cisco will be implementing a new feature with this router in the Summer of 2012 called ""Cisco Connect Cloud"". Although this feature is not yet available, they say that we will be able to get ""new apps and capabilities to enrich your connected lifestyle."" I'm excited to discover what that means and will be looking forward to that implementation. I'll update this review when the feature has been implemented and I've explored it.This router does support both IPv4 and IPv6 so it should work with whichever protocol your ISP currently uses. Mine is still on IPV4, and I can attest to it working well with this older protocol. Until Comcast upgrades me to the IPV6, however, I can only state that the IPV6 is supported, but I cannot test it myself.All in all, this router is leaps and bounds above any of the Linksys routers (or their competitor Belkin) that I have used for years. At this point, I would highly recommend the Linksys EA4500 router to someone looking for a stable, fast, high-end router with a decent range and great speeds. I would give it 4.5 stars if Amazon supported half stars, but am giving it 4 since they do not. The only thing I am counting off on is the somewhat lax security I described with the Cisco Connect utility.Wireless Devices connected to my network:HP dv4-1140go laptopASUS Eee PC 1000HE 10.1-Inch Black Netbook - 9.5 Hour Battery Life2Roku 2 XS 1080p Streaming PlayerHTC EVO 3D 4G Android Phone, Black (Sprint)Cisco-Linksys AE1000 High-Performance Wireless-N AdapterLinksys AE2500 Dual-Band Wireless-N USB AdapterBelkin B004N625B42TiVo AN0100 Wireless N Network Adapter (Gray)TiVo AG0100 Wireless G USB Network Adapter for TiVo Series 2 and Series 3 DVRsPandigital Planet Android 2.2 2 GB 7-Inch Multimedia Tablet and Color eReader with Kindle, R70A200FR (Black)Magellan RoadMate 5175T-LM GPS navigatorLogitech Squeezebox Boom All-in-One Network Music Player / Wi-Fi Internet RadioLexmark 4800 Series PrinterHTC Imagio PhoneWired Devices connected to my network:Ooma Telo Free Home Phone ServiceNETGEAR ReadyNAS Duo 2-Bay 500 GB (1 x 500 GB) Network Attached Storage RND2150TRENDnet 8-Port Unmanaged Gigabit GREENnet Standard Switch (8 x 10/100/1000Mbps)Seagate BlackArmor NAS 110 1 TB Network Attached Storage ST310005MNA10G-RKPogoplug MobileDesktop PC","04 26, 2012",A23ZNGL704AW7O,Jennifer Ray,96.0,Powerful router is easy to set up and much more stable than its predecessors,84.0,921.0,1335398400.0,3141.0,23.1760255211,11.6110523505,11.5649731706,0.129616028054,0.0,0.872817507826

It's that good.HandlingThis camera is brilliant to hold and use. Nikon has done it again and has made the user interface more usable and streamlined. What to change flash modes. Press the flash pop-up button and rotate the control wheel. Sweet. Want to change create and use a User defined mode? There are two. Set your mode up. Go to the menu and save it. To use it rotate the shooting mode dial to U1 or U2. Presto you are there. In the D300 and D700 you to have to setup things in the menu and switch in the menu. Also, there were 2 sets of things you could change and they were not all inclusive. It was all horribly confusing and I never used it. Speaking of shooting modes. There is now one position on the shooting mode dial for scene mode shooting. You change through the different scene modes with the control wheel and the type scene shows up on the back screen. Sweet. I can go on and on but needless to say Nikon have really improved their interface. One caveat, I don't think it is quite up to par with the GH1 to change exposure compensation (IMO the most important control) but still a huge step in the correct direction in handling. I like the handling of the  D7000 better than either the D700/300.Low Light ShootingThe D300 wasn't that great for Hi ISO. It shoots clean at 400 ISO and usable up to 1600. (The D90 and D300s were better) The D700 was fantastic. Clean at 1600 ISO and usable up to 6400. It opened up new worlds. The D7000 is close to the equal of the D700. Enough said. Just to give you an example. The bouquet toss at a reception is often done in poor light. By using 1600 instead of 400 you get the equivalent of 4 times more light. At ISO400 you flash may need to use 1/4 power and you can get 1 maybe 2 shots of the toss and catch before the flash needs to recharge. At ISO1600 your flash would only need to use 1/16th power and now you can get 5-6 shots. This is huge.Picture QualityLike all modern DSLRs it takes great pictures. I don't pixel peep so I can't really say that I notice a difference between the pictures from the D7000 and any of my 12mp cameras. It makes really nice pictures and that is all I care about.Useful Photography Features (Not Marketing Features)--100% view finder! Big bright with 100% coverage. No more guessing of your framing. (It is not as bright as the D700. However, it is 100% vice 95%)--2 SD slots - When your getting paid to shoot a wedding or any gig, my card broke is not an excuse. Very useful feature. For the home user put two smaller cards rather than one big card and save some money.--Smaller and lighter than D300, D700, D3s, D3x- When you stand on your feet for 9 hours shooting the wedding and reception, you start to feel every ounce you are carrying. Often you will be carrying two bodies with a fast tele zoom and fast wide zoom. That starts to get heavy. Light weight here we come.--2016-Segment RGB Meter- for spot on exposure and white balance--No one touches Nikon on this and this one is fantastic.--1/8000th -- Very useful for shooting into the sun wide open with a bright lens--1/250 -- Could be better (1/500th for D40) but could be much worse. Auto FP helps.--Magnesium body and better sealing -- Shoot in dusty environments without messing up the inside your camera.--Uses the ML-L3 infra red remote -- Small and cheap. IR sensor on the front and back of the camera.--Autofocus focus motor for non-AF-S lensesMarketing Features that will sometimes be Useful--16Mp -- Nikon was obviously getting creamed in the marketing wars on this. This is going to lead to bigger files requiring larger hard drives and faster computers. Occasionally it will be useful if you can't frame as close as you would like and you need to crop or you need to print big. Alien Skin Blow Up 2, Image Resizing Plug-in Software for Photoshop, Macintosh & Windows and Genuine Fractals 6 Professional Edition 1-user Full are two very nice programs that can increase the size of your photos for printing large. 16 MP is nice by not necessary.--39 Point Auto Focus -- To me in some ways this is better than the 51 point of the D300 and D700 as that gets too unwieldy. However, you really don't even need 39. However, still useful on occasion.--6 frames per second-- I very rarely ever put my camera in 3 frames per second. When I do so it fills the card quickly. If you are shooting the big game then 6 is nice. Or it is nice for some cool special effects shots. Other than that you won't really find yourself using it that much.VideoThe other thing I am not really going to dwell on is the video capabilities. In my opinion all the various video options are mostly marketing hype really targeted at a niche market. Shallow depth of field video is difficult and time consuming to shoot and edit properly. The average family home user has neither the time nor inclination to do this. With that said, it is nice to only have to carry one device to take still pictures and video. So I do enjoy that feature, however 1080 is not really necessary. In fact with up converting DVD players standard def is still very usable and takes up far less space. Suffice it to say that the video capabilities are very good and should do anything a home user would need it to do. Can be used for pro Videos as demonstrated by Chase Jarvis.IntangiblesThis is a very nice camera and it feels very solid in your hands. It feels far more substantial than the D40/D90 without feeling like a brick the way the D300/D700 do. I am sure the D300 has more marketing features than the D7000 but I would have to research them to figure out what they are.ConclusionIn the end it all comes down to what is important to you. Smaller weight and size is becoming much more important to me and this camera is a very good trade off of features for size and weight. Anything that is missing I don't even use so I am not sure what it may be. My D700 was recently stolen and while I miss it, the D7000 is a worthy replacement for it. I opted to get the D7000 and Panasonic GH2 and save the $300 difference for a lens.Pros--100% view finder!--6 fps (7D is 8. However, I think this number is overhyped in most cases. Even shooting at 3 FPS will fill up you card with photos that look remarkably similar) 8+ is needed for professionals shooting professional sports. Not enthusiast shooting High School etc.--16mp sensor (a marketing increase but still nice to allow some room for cropping)--14 bit photos--39 point auto focus sensors (19 cross point) this is a bit of a marketing thing but it is still nice and it does not matter about the 51 on D300s and above. Still very nice.--2016 scene meter - compares against data base for WB setting and color settings--Excellent battery life--MD-11 Optional Battery Grip--2 SD card slots for back up redundancy or double the card space! Outstanding--Magnesium used to make camera strongerCons--16mp senor (takes up more storage on your hard drive) (12mp JPG 3mb 12 mp RAW = 12 mb 16mp JPEG = 5 mb 16 mp RAW = 16 mb. This is for 12 bit. 14 bit would require more)--Camera heavier than it used to be--No swivel screen - after using the GH1 extensively you really miss this when shooting at weird angles. You especially miss it for macro photography.--No full time live view - Ditto from above. Live view is what you see is what you get. Forgot to change white balance-- you will see that when people are yellow, blue or green. Have it set in manual and blowing everything out-- you'll see that as a white screen.Decision MatrixNikonFor the Nikon shooter this is a no brainer. If you are in the market for a camera, then skip the D300s. The D700 is getting long in the tooth and many people are buying the D7000 while waiting for D800. If you already own a D700 then this camera is a very good complement to it. Use the money you saved over the more expensive camera to buy a nice lens.Here is a breakdown vs other Nikon DSLRsD3100-- Two completely different classes with the D7000 being worth the difference in many. However at the end of the day they will both make nice pictures. Also, the lenses are more important than the camera. You can get the D3100 and 18-200mm for the same price. Something to think about.D5000-- Good sensor and nice camera. D3100 comments also apply here.D90--Tough choice. The best DX sensor of its generation and still better than most. If you can't quite stretch to the D7000, this is a very tempting proposition.D300S-- Irrelevant.  The D7000 has a much better sensor, is smaller, lighter, cheaper, and better metering.Nikon D700-- Would be a good complement to the D7000. Use D7000 when you need the 1.5x crop on the long end and a deeper depth of field due to the smaller chip (about 1 stop deeper) and D700 for when you want to isolate a subject with a shallow depth of field or you want to use the full width of a wide angle such as the 14-24mm. If you don't need the shallower depth of field of a FX sensor and you have the lenses to cover the 1.5x crop then the D7000 should suit just fine. D3s and D3x -- Different leagues altogether. However, the D7000 is 90% of the camera for 1/4 to 1/6th the money.CanonThe 7D is an outstanding camera and while I think the D7000 is a better camera (better sensor, 2 SD card slots, 2016 RGB metering, Price) it is not that much better to warrant switching if you are already invested in lenses.SonyThe Sony SLT-A55 is a great camera but not in the league of the D7000. However it is $350 less and does have so unique properties.  It is rumored to have the same sensor as the D7000 but Nikon always does their magic and makes it better (D3x vs A900).  The translucent mirror allows for fast shooting but loses 1/3 a stop of light.  Still a very nice camera.Non-DSLR Owner or DSLR owner with just the Kit LensWhen you are buying a DSLR, you are really buying into the lens system.  So factor that into you decision making matrix.  For that reason, if you have not spent a fortune on lenses yet then I recommend the m4/3 as in my opinion that is the future.  The sensor of the top m4/3(GH2) is every bit as good if not better than the current crop of DX sensors and almost as good as the D7000.  It is getting to the point, the sensor doesn't matter as much.  At this point handling, size and weight start to become more important.With this in mind I would recommend thePanasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 16.05 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-inch Free-Angle Touch Screen LCD and 14-42mm Hybrid Lens (Black)to anyone not invested in a lens system. It is smaller, lighter, more capable on the video side and in many ways better on the stills side. It needs a faster flash sync speed, faster shutter speed and the construction is not up to Nikon or Canon standards (In all fairness this cuts down on weight and I have not had a failure with my GH1.)  It is probably not quite as good at the high ISO. On the positive side it has a multi-aspect sensor as it is actually an 18mp sensor (16:9, 2:3, and 4:3 will all be 16mp not crops of one aspect ratio) It sells for $899 body only, $999 with the 14-42mm and $1499 with the fantastic 14-140mm 10x zoom. The lack of a mirror flipping up is a benefit in all cases. Also, you can use just about any lens ever made on this camera. Nikon, Leica, Canon, Pentax, C Lenses. You lose auto focus on any auto focus lenses and there is no accurate way to adjust your aperture on G series lenses.  While the GH1 sensor was by far the best M4/3 sensor and equaled most DX sensors of its generation, it did not quite stand up to the D90 sensor. I expect the D7000 to have a higher Dynamic Range and be an overall better sensor. However, that difference will not be noticeable to the lay users. What you get is a noticeably smaller and lighter camera that out handles any DSLR on the market and has the best video capabilities. In my opinion the GH2 will be the best all-around camera of its generation. The GH1 is the camera I reach for 90% of the time when I shoot for pleasure. When Panasonic puts out a full Pro line of lenses, I will use it more in the Pro situations. I am sure the GH2 will be my new go to camera.","10 20, 2010",A7FDGFK0KN7QG,"shuTTL3bus ""shuTTL3bus @gmail .com""",123.0,Great Camera -- A perspective from a D300/700 Owner,1303.0,805.0,1287532800.0,2345.0,43.5735110985,21.2217562876,22.3517548109,0.0676889393796,0.0,0.873113662414

I fell in love with the compact form factor and packability of the Solemate, but the sound left something to be desired for music. If this will be your first sub-compact travel speaker you are in for a modern treat. Even with the mediocre sound of the competition, the convenience of this type of speaker is a godsend to anyone who travels or spends time outdoors.This speaker is made for music. I listen to classic rock, classic soul, and 90s-10s alt-rock. Highs are clear. Mids are clear and undistorted. Even at full volume, ""busy"" music with a lot of bass layered over vocals will not muddle the sound. Bass is full and feels great in a small-medium sized room. The reason to buy this over other similar products is the quality of the bass. My Jabra Solemate has great mids and highs. This thing has full range sound. If the room is much larger than about 200sq-ft, the Bose Mini will begin to feel a bit small, but it is room-filling full range sound in smaller rooms. It really is good enough to be the only sound system in a bedroom. It will work in a pinch in a larger living space. Outdoors, it has enough power for background sound at a large gathering. I held a cookout for 40 people recently and it was adequate in an area of about 20ftx30ft. You really could not appreciate the bass in this outdoor setting, but the sound was clear and several people asked where I bought it. It moves enough air that in a small room like my kitchen or bathroom, I swear I can feel the bass through my shoes. It really can ""thump"" in a small room. If you love to really feel the groove of a bass guitar or the thump of a bass drum in rock music, this will satisfy!Connecting is a piece of cake. Anyone can do it and you probably won't need the manual. The only drawback to this device is that it will only connect to one source at once. I am spoiled by the Jabra in this regard. The Jabra will connect to my iPhone and iPad at the same time. The Jabra will switch between bluetooth sources depending on which one demands audio output. This Bose will only connect to one at a time. I have a 50/50 shot of which one it chooses. If it chooses the wrong one, I must switch-off bluetooth on the device I want it to ignore. Maybe someday Bose will fix this with a software update (fingers crossed).As an alternative to Bluetooth, you can connect a device using a 3.5mm male-to-male cable (not included).The build quality is excellent. It looks like it was designed and built by Apple. It is made from the same aluminum material as Macbook Pro laptops. It feels very substantial in your hand. Heavy for its size. It is about the size of a 1/2-liter bottle of water, and it weighs 50% more than the bottle of water. The bottom is rubberized so it won't vibrate off of a tabletop. The only slight drawback to the build is the feel of the buttons. They are recessed below a plastic covering. I fear that these buttons are where the device will eventually wear out based on my experience with similar controls. Only time will truly tell how durable it is. This is the type of device which will get daily use from most people, and the price means it should not be disposable: durability is a must.  I'll update in the future if I have any issues.I really like the dock. It is much easier than fumbling around to shove a cable into a device. More portable products need to include a dock. I keep my Bose Mini near the front door resting in its dock so it's ready when I need it. Unfortunately, Bose selected a proprietary connector for the power supply cable. I would have preferred a micro USB charging connector. On the plus side, the power supply is compact with folding prongs and can serve as a travel cable without the dock attached.Battery life has been great, but I haven't tested it to see if it will last the advertised 7 hours. The day I held the large cookout, it was kept at near full volume for about 5 hours with no problem. I have had it in a hotel at low volume for about 5-6 hours without recharging. A really great battery-saving feature is that it will automatically shut down when not in use. At bedtime, I like to play music from my phone when staying at a hotel with the sleep timer set. When the phone stops delivering music, the Bose Mini just switches off so it won't be dead in the morning.Some of the competitive products will act as a speakerphone. This Bose will not. I don't really consider this to be a drawback because the speakerphone option of most of the competitive products is an afterthought and doesn't work well (like my Jabra Solemate).Bose offers a travel case which will hold the Mini and the travel power supply for $45. It really should have been included and $45 is steep. Having said that, I will probably be buying it. I had the device loose in an overnight bag a couple weeks ago and it switched itself on because the power button brushed up against something in my bag. I heard the chirp from my bag indicating that the device had connected and was able to switch it off. It really needs a semi-rigid case for travel.Bose has built a winner here. This is going to be like the Macbook in a year or two: everyone will have one and never travel without one. It is so much better than the plastic-y budget competition that the choice is easy. Buy this now; you will be delighted. It's worth the money.","07 22, 2013",A3I04RM049YS8Y,Jeffrey Stanley,64.0,Fantastic.

I spent over 25 hours testing and evaluating the unit during the week that I owned it.  Several hours of this time were spent talking with three people on the Cisco / Linksys customer support line and at least two hours were spent on the manufacturer's website.  The website has nothing in the way of support for this item because it is so new.  Most of the information is related to marketing, specifications and features.  The people on the customer support line were very friendly but they also told me that this is a new product and they don't have any experience with it.  They documented my issues and stated that they would forward the information up the line.  I only had a limited amount of time to return the unit for a refund so I reluctantly sent the router back to the vendor.  This router looks great and it has the best specifications and features of any router that I researched.  Unfortunately the router looks good on paper but it didn't live up to even my most minimal expectations!  The problems I encountered are listed below:Installation:I followed the instructions and it seemed that the installation went well but the router failed to connect to the internet.  It took four hardware resets of the router and my cable modem to finally get the router to connect.  This is an issue in the event of a power failure.  It requires a physical, hardware reset of the modem and router to get the two to communicate after a power failure.  Thus remote access is unreliable.USB disk installation:I purchased a new 3 Terabyte Seagate Backup Plus drive to connect to the router.  The disk was NTFS formatted by Seagate and included pre-installed software.  I followed the instructions but the router and the Cisco software interface would not detect the drive after I connected it to the USB port.  I finally disconnected the drive and reconnected it to my PC only to discover that the PC said the drive was corrupted!  I had to reformat the drive using the NTFS format and I lost all of the files on the drive!  I tried this process several times with the same result.  Every time I connected the drive to the router, it was corrupted by the router!  I finally formatted the drive using the Apple OS X extended journaled format and the router immediately recognized the drive.  Thus the router seems to have a problem with high capacity NTFS formatted drives.  I attached a small 16 Gig jump drive to the router and it also recognized the FAT 32 formatted jump drive.  16 Gig is useless for a network drive!Spin baby spin...The router never puts the attached hard disk to sleep during periods of non-use!  It spins 24 hours a day.  If you want to drastically reduce the life of your hard disk, this is the router for you.Un-reliable disk access and loss of files:Once you find the disk on your computer, it shows up sometimes and not others.  This seems random...  It also disconnects during large file transfers.  The most unacceptable behavior is that if the disk experiences a power failure, ALL files that have been transferred to the disk since the last ""safe disconnect"" WILL be LOST!  I tested this four times.  Thus the ability to reliably use the disk from a remote location is useless.  You cannot remotely safely disconnect the drive and then reconnect it without physically pulling the USB connection.Windows, Windows, Windows...When you install the software, a shortcut to the router software is placed on your desktop.  If you double click on the shortcut, it opens an internet browser window that allows you to login to the router.  Unfortunately, if you have other browsers open or minimized, it opens a new window in EVERY internet browser that you have open!!!  I had the router software open 15 windows from a single double click.  Did Cisco ever test this router and its GUI before they put it on the market?My background:I'm only including this so that the reader can evaluate the source of the review.  I have an advanced degree in electrical engineering with a strong background in computer science.  I've developed complete software applications for PC and Apple computers for over 30 years.  A major part of my work has involved system integration.  This requires interfacing computer hardware with external devices and it involves communication between multiple software platforms.Believe it or not, this is the short version of my review on this router and I've only listed the main points that effect performance.  I wrote a four page version so that I was prepared to talk with customer support.  It's very unfortunate that the router does not live up to its marketing documentation.  It looked great on my desk before I returned it but I needed a reliable router that would give me remote access to an attached hard disk even in the event of a minor power interruption.  This router ended up being nothing more than an expensive paperweight!  In the end, I returned the EA6500 and re-installed my previous router.  My previous router is an old Linksys that has provided me with wonderful service for many years even when the power is interrupted.  This is why I purchased the new Cisco / Linksys EA6500 in the first place.  I purchased it for the performance and the features.  It cost me a lot of money and time to test this router but I'm mostly disappointed that I had to send it back because it simply didn't perform as advertised.  I'm still searching for a new router...","10 12, 2012",A3EN48HL6EXS9M,RAB,51.0,Please read this before you buy or if you are having problems.,28.0,392.0,1350000000.0,980.0,21.5079050423,11.0474420523,10.46046299,0.142092595972,0.0,0.872783223554

Tested it with a few shots using my trusty 28-135mm IS lens. Other people have already highly praised this camera. For those looking to decide whether not to upgrade from XSI (or any other camera), here's a run down:1) AUTOFOCUS:the T2i's autofocus beats the XSI hands down. I've had the xsi for two years and while i was happy with it overall, there were often moments of soft shots. Do a search for ""front-focus""...it'll show a lot of threads that was problematic of the XSI. No such issues with the T2i. It locks on focus quickly and effortlessly and pictures turn out very sharp using my 28-135mm IS lens. I can get quality shots even at 1/10s handheld and 3200 iso in low light, but that's also dependent on the IS of the lens.2) METERINGThe T2i inherits the 7d's metering system. I like it. color tones are more accurate and appropriate to reflect how an object really looks. One thing to consider, if you accidently set white balance to incandescent light while u take shots w/o flash and happen to use flash on the image, the end result will be a picture w/ a heavy blue cast. If it's shot in raw, easily edited in dpp.3) EXPOSUREI have a gut feeling that the T2i's sensor is a tad bit over sensitive causing pictures to be slightly over-exposed compared to my XSI. I think i'll learn with time. On a typical shot, I think the XSI has a color that's a tad bit richer/pleasing in jpeg. Haven't tried out raw. Still tweaking the settings of my t2i.4) BATTERY LIFEHaven't tried it long enuff and will comment later. The charger has a cord. I suspect it might be canon's way of saving money to allow for different cords to be shipped w/ different units depending on the country. On first charge, i got out 400 shots w/ about 20 being flash shots when battery meter was at half. I had another event to go to so I recharged it at that point. Took about 1-2 hrs to recharge. For those looking to generic batteries, there's discussions on dpreview of generic batteries from ebay that last 600 shots while battery meter still being full. After that, it sharply goes down in half and empty so a little more unpredictable than the canon ones but battery life still terrific.5) BUILD QUALITYSeems almost as sturdy as the XSI. However, noticed battery door on T2i seems a bit loose and not snug like XSI. The little knob on the right next to the shutter (that you use to adjust the AF points) seems more sturdy on the xsi than the T2i. i.e. on the T2i, if u apply a bit of pressure, it rocks a bit but doesn't do the same on my old xsi.6) LCDThe t2i's lcd screen is amazing. Very vibrant and lots of pixels. Much better than XSI's. I'd recommend getting an lcd protector (plastic film) to add here. I'd recommend you get a 3.5 to 4"" lcd protector and cut it out to fit the LCD screen. The ones on ebay that advertise ""T2i screen protector"" tend to be 1-2mm smaller than advertised since the LCD borders itself slightly curved.7) VALUEAt $799 for camera alone, this is the best value u can get right now for a camera that does 1080p video. The technology is here to stay. Best thing about this camera are 1) video at 1080p 2) 7d's metering system 3) usable iso 3200 that looks better than iso 400 on my canon point and shoot. Getting the camera alone is hard if you already have a set of lenses for this camera. If you decide to get the kit lens instead (18-55mm IS), you can sell the kit lens for around $90-100.8)SOFTWAREThe main thing I use is DPP to process RAW. One major fault with it is that you need 1024x768 screen to install/run it. As a result, it won't run on my netbook unless I attach a hdtv or external monitor to it. I have the Lenovo S10-2. Works fine on my regular laptop. You can also use EOS Utility to added your name/contact info to all the images taken.9) VIDEOTo be honest, video recording isn't very intuitive the first time I tried it. You have to turn the knob to the video recorder icon. Then you pressure the button for live view/red dot to record. It doesn't say the amount of time you've recorded unless you press the DISP button. You can also take photos during the recording by pressing the shutter button but that will add noise to video. Now that I've gotten used to it, not a major problem and makes sense. The AF mechanism of the 28-125 mm IS lens constantly makes noise during this time.10) MEMORY CARDI use a Sandisk Extreme III Class 6 SDHC 8 gb/4gb card. Takes all my videos w/o problems even at 1920x1080 at 30 fps.SOME CONCERNS:A) WHITE DOTSFor those new to this camera, at high ISO i.e. 3200+, you will see intermittent white dots that appear out of nowhere. It's like white speckles. This can be seen on dpreview's review of the t2i on 3200 ISO and even on the 7d. These are noise/hot pixels, and not dead pixels. You can either remove them in photoshop using the dust/scratch removal w/ radius 1 and threshold 10. Or, you can turn on high ISO noise reduction. You don't need to send the camera to manufacturer for this issue.B) OVEREXPOSUREI have the gut feeling that this camera's ultra sensitive senors tends to overexposed. Outdoors, I'd have to change the exposure compensation a bit up to -1 to get the desired exposure. Of note, where the focus points are centered also determines what metering is done for the image.C) SLOW AUTOFOCUS WITH CONTRAST DETECTAF using the contrast detect method w/ Liveview is slow and noisy. However, it's improved over XSI and easier to engage. Just press the Live view icon and start shooting.D) NO MINI-HDMI CABLE IN BOX TO STREAM TO TVI didn't find an mini-HDMI cable in my camera to stream to tv. Ordered one through ebay for $5. For $900, you would think they'd include this.E) RED AUTOFOCUS POINTS APPEAR BLURRY:When you look through the viewfinder, you'll sometimes notice that the AF points are blurry, particularly the lower ones which has appearance of reddish halo around them. This is likely due to diffraction and should not affect the ability of camera to focus properly.F) POSSIBLE FRONT FOCUS ISSUE:One poster on dpreview claims that the camera front focuses on fast lenses such as the 50mm f/1.4 lens. Read the thread for details. Personally, I've used the 28-135mm IS lens w/o focusing issues.[...]","04 16, 2010",AU8E774SC8TWK,Just another reviewer,65.0,A solid camera!...with one caveat,116.0,552.0,1271376000.0,1213.0,37.3545266607,18.1621196983,19.1924069624,0.078874456156,0.0,0.873110378626

They make an excellent combination and the old Nikon lenses can be obtained for relatively cheap. What I have to say my be true for other lenses such as Canon but I have no experience with them.NEX-6 REVIEWIt's an excellent camera. I was attracted to it because of its low light capability and it's viewfinder. Both are excellent. I can usually shoot at ISO 3200 if I need to and get good results. The viewfinder is big and bright and I would not consider a high-end camera without a viable viewfinder, especially when using old lenses. I think the software is horrible. It is poorly organized and some functions are named so that you would never know what the function is unless you dig into the documentation. I would not recommend this camera for a novice. Overall I rate it at four stars.WHY OLD LENSES?Actually, I found out that I could use an old Nikon 50mm f/2 lens I had that's close to 50 years old. So I gave it a shot and it worked great. Everything is done manually and I find that improves my photography because I actually get to think about what I'm doing. With the NEX-6's 1.5 crop factor the 50mm is equivalent to 75mm for a 35mm format. This lens has become my favorite lens, again. Once I realized the 50mm worked so well I was hooked.I soon discovered that I could acquire some of the best lenses Nikon ever made at low cost. I probably went a little overboard but now I have a great collection of six Nikon prime lenses ranging from a 20mm f/2.8 to a 200mm f/f4. I even purchased  an 80-200mm zoom that's built like, and weighs like a tank. The total cost of five lenses I purchased was $500. I believe the equivalent optical power in new lenses would cost thousands.WHAT YOU GIVE UPYou give up autofocus, anti-shake, and many other automatic capabilities. But you don;t give up everything and not the ones that I think could the most for the quality of your photos. With a Nikon lens mounted you basically have a limited functioning camera and a lens. The rest is up to you, the photographer. You also sacrifice having the lightest weight and compact camera and lens. The Nikon lenses are known for their rugged metal construction and so they are heavier than today's lenses. If you only want to aim your camera and press the shutter I would not recommend this path. You can stop reading now.PICKING LENSESThe lenses I go for are the Nikon's made anywhere from the 60's through the 80's. They are either ""AI"" or non-AI (older are non-AI). You can read about AI on Ken Rockwell's site mentioned next. Basically, to AI or not makes no difference on the NEX-6 in and of itself. However, AI lens may have higher resale value but they generally cost more.There is an excellent web site by Ken Rockwell. Do a Google search and you will find it. Ken has reviewed just about every Nikon lens ever made, in fact it may be all for all I know. Although his reviews are based on all-Nikon shooting (camera + lens), I found the reviews to be very helpful, allowing me to select the lenses I wanted to hunt for (which turns out to be easy, more below. He has separate pages for the best and worst lenses and he explains his reasoning. Call me crazy, but I focused on the best lenses.Do not purchase ""G"" lenses. I have not used any but I think they have a different mount than all the others and I have been told they won't work.THE SECRET SAUCEIn order to use the lenses on an NEX-6 you need a lens adapter. I chose theNikon Lens to Sony NEX E-Mount Camera Mount Adapterwhich is about $15 on Amazon. It gets the job done. But because I was committed to using the old lenses I decided to purchase an adapter for each lens which obviously adds some cost.  But I wanted the convenience of having the adapter+lens combination as a single unit to make it quick and easy to mount the lens.Attach a lens. Then turn on Peaking which allows you to make precise manual focusing adjustments by highlighting the edges that are in focus in your choice of three colors (white, red, or yellow). I wouldn't even consider old lenses on a modern camera unless there was something comparable to the Peaking technology.Go to SetupGo to Peaking Level and select a level. I like medium.Go to Peaking Color and select a color. I like red.In order to use your Nikon lens you have to go into the menu system again and change a menu setting, which has a name that sounds like nothing of what it does.Go to SetupGo to ""Release w/o Lens'Set it to ""Enable""The camera will now work with non-Sony lenses like Nikons.When you switch the lens back to a Sony E-mount lens change the Release w/o Lens setting to ""Disable"".I also set ""Menu Start"" in Setup to Previous so that I can quickly get back to Release w/o Lens when that was the last setting I changed and I want to use my E-Mount lens.USING THE LENSESLike I said, everything is manual. I'm still experimenting with exposure combinations but there is a way to use the lens that works well for me under many lighting conditions. I set the ISO to auto. Auto ISO on the NEX-6 will not go over 3200 so that's fine for me. I set to S for shutter speed control and usually set the speed for the conditions while being careful to follow a rule of thumb of having a shutter speed set to a value that is at 1.5X the focal length of the lens to minimize motion blur in hand held shots.  For example, with the 50mm lens, 1.5x is 75. So I want the shutter speed faster, usually 1/100 of a second or faster.With those settings I am free to pay attention to f-stop knowing that the ISO will auto adjust as needed. This is evident in the viewfinder because you can see the final exposure and see if it looks right to you. Mostly it does unless it is very bright or very dark. Then more shutter speed and aperture adjustment is needed.With the shutter speed set I then make the manual aperture setting the focus of my attention. For great Bokeh with the 50mm lens I'll shoot wide open at f/2.ACQUIRING LENSESOnce I have decided which lens I want I'll shop on eBay. I haven't found a lens that isn't available there. By doing a search you will quickly get a sense for what a reasonable price range is. If you want to bid you may wind up getting a phenomenal lens at a great price.  Me, I'm the impatient type so I purchased all my lenses as ""but it now"".But there are some very specific things I look for in a lens and seller.1. The rating of the seller. I stick with 99+% buyer feedback. And there are many that fit that.2. Returns. I want a seller that has at least a 14 day return policy. If no returns I move on.3. Lens description--I read descriptions carefully to see if that's what I want. The good sellers will have good descriptions and lots of photos.4. Cost--I look for a price that's acceptable to me for the lens. The prices can vary widely to unreasonably low for a lens that has problems, to unreasonably high by sellers who I suppose want to prey on the naive buyer . But like I said, with a little bit of comparison shopping it becomes pretty easy to tell what fair price is. For example, the 50mm f/2 Nikkor AI or pre-AI, a terrific lens, can currently be had for about $50 (But It Now), or less in an auction.5. Shipping--I look for free shipping or up to about $10. There are overseas sellers and their shipping will stand out as being much higher, $20, $30, or more. I stick with US sellers.I did buy one lens off of Craig's list and that worked out great. The seller was nearby, a delightful person, and a professional photographer who gave me some photography tips.  THAT lens is a Nikkor 20mm (30 mm on the NEX-6) f/2.8. It is my most expensive lens at $200 but $100 or more dollars cheaper then if I purchased it on eBay.When I get the lens I test it. I make sure everything moves okay and that's generally smooth as silk like Nikon lenses usually are. Then I do some shooting test. They will include a shot or two at a clear part of the sky or cloudy sky, stopped down as far as the lens will go, f/22 for my lenses.  This type of shot will bring out lens imperfections such as scratches or other problems. The lenses I got all checked out great except for one lens that had very noticeable spots in the viewfinder with the lens stopped down. But I couldn't see anything on the lens so I blew on the sensor. That fixed the spots. It was dust on the sensor.The honest vendors will state the condition of the lens. I purchased a couple of lenses where the seller said there was a mild scratch in the coating. When I got the lens I thought the problems were overstated because I could not see anything. But I appreciated the honesty. The lens tests look fine to me so I kept the lenses.My lenses test always includes transferring the images to the computer and carefully examining the images for problems.  They have all passed with flying colors.I did return one lens because it had a built in lens shade and the paint was peeling somewhat. The peeling was visible in the sellers pictures but in person I know it would continue to bother me aesthetically although the lens tested fine. The seller took it back, no questions asked and made the process very easy.CONCLUSIONI have tried to bring out the main things that are important to me and what I've learned about using a state-of-the-art NEX-6 with old, high quality Nikon lenses. I don't claim to be a photo expert but I have been a life-long amateur photographer. I'm also sure there are people who would say why this route is a really dumb idea. Ken Rockwell for one is a big fan of auto everything. I might be too if I had really deep pockets. This way I can have the enjoyment of bringing great variety and optical quality to my photography at prices I can afford. And like I said, I think going manual with a quality prime lens makes me a better photographer.","08 10, 2013",A2GIQAA9O73TO5,S.

I am an avid amateur. I am a member of the Delaware Photographic Society of which I am the Equipment Chair, and the Photographic Society of America.I have been shooting my D800 for over 6 weeks. I have about 1500 shutter actuations. My previous (and still owned) DSLR IS a Nikon D300 (22,000+ shutter actuations). I use a number of lenses, including a very excellent Nikkor AF 80-200mm f/2.8 (circa 1995) lens, and also the outstanding AF Nikkor 35-70mm f/2.8. I also have 4 AF-S lenses including the 105 f/2.8, the 28-300 and the 10-24 DX, and the 50mm f/1.4..I have gone into detail on my lenses so you will know what I have been using on the camera. Please note, before continuing this review - it is the photographer that produces the images, the camera only records what the photographer sees, and the camera body is less important to the quality of the photo than is the glass on the front of the camera. Poor lenses will produce poor photos on any camera made.I have read reviews complaining about focus issues. I have had no trouble with focus or sharpness of my photographs with this camera. I must respectfully disagree with the other reviews which complain about focus on the D800. I seldom use a tripod and have not felt compelled to do. I recently shot two events with both of my cameras - the professional bicycle race in Philadelphia (June 3) and the more recent MS Society MuckRuckus in Newtown Square, PA. Both events were action events and I found no difference between the two cameeras on the quality of the images concerning focus. The Camera behaved flawlessly. My biggest issue with sharpness of my photos is when I am too quick on the trigger, not the camera's fault.This camera has 1 drawback to my shooting - the slow frame rate on continuous high speed shooting. I suspect that is due to the large file size with respect to the size of the buffer memory in the camera. Having said that I can still get 6 frames a second with a battery pack (and essential item of my inventory - never have to worry about missing a moment due to battery change) and shooting in DX Mode. That gives me 19MP images which is more than large enough if I frame the photo anywhere near correctly. That is my one big Con on the list.Pros:1. High ISO performance: I have no fear kicking the ISO up to as much as 4000 (or more) thousand for regular shooting. In my own limited experiments I have found miniscule noise difference between ISO 400 and ISO 4000. That enables me to use very high shutter speeds with my fast glass. That in turn has essentially removed all real concerns about sharpness.2. AF Performance: On my D300 I have had some issues with older non-AF-S lenses due to relatively slow focus rate by the mechanical drive. however, with AF-S lenses it was wonderful. On my D800 those concerns have evaporated. The mechanical drive focus lenses (read AF Nikkor) focus so fast, the focus rate is almost indistinguishable from the AF-S lenses. I use both freely, without concern on the camera, and have had great success with both.3. Lens compatibility: I can use almost any lens made by Nikon since 1959. Older lenses do need to have be converted to AI (Aperture Index) configuration unless they are fixed aperture (Cat lens - f/8 only). That is also true for my D300 so that is not a change. But that fact is one of the major contributing factors in my choosing Nikon over other brands. In addition, though the D800 is a full frame sensor camera it will use my APS-C lenses as well - it simply switches to DX (Nikon's term for APS-C) mode and includes a black frame in the view finder to show the coverage of the lens. Some of my best lenses are used lenses I bought for a song compared with newer lenses and have given me truly wonderful results. I can use every lens I have with either camera D300 (DX or APS-C) and D800 (FX or full frame).4. Build quality: True the camera is not quite built like the D4, but then it costs half as much. Over all I have found it to be a very solid, well built, well balanced camera. I have already been caught in soft  rain and drizzle with the camera and have had no problems with it weather sealing. I have had no software issues with the camera either - no freezing or other glitches in its operation.5. Update: Since I submitted the review I remembered something else that is a definite Pro. Raw File size: The D800 will take pictures in 12 or 14 bit color depth. When shooting uncompressed Raw files in 14 bit color depth the file size is about 75MB per photo. However Nikon has included 2 versions of Raw recording which create smaller files. There is a mode called ""Lossless compressed Raw"". Lossless compressed mode compresses the files with a reversible compression algorithm. If you choose""Lossless compressed Raw"" and use 12 instead 14 bit color depth the file size per photo is reduced to about 32.4MB, less than half of the largest file size. There is also a ""Compressed Raw"" mode, which using 12 bit color depth reduces the file size further to 29MB. Compressed Raw is not reversible, but the image quality difference is really minuscule (if any) compared to uncompressed or Lossless compressed.Cons:1. Low frame rate for continuous high speed shooting including bracketing.2. Cost - but that is niggling considering the abilities the camera brings to the table.I could go on longer, but this is enough for the moment. I highly recommend the camera but only for very avid amateurs, semi-professional or professional photographers. It is a complex tool capable of doing a great deal. But it takes time to learn to use properly - it can not be done in one day, or even a month. It will take time and use to master this camera. I have not met a casual amateur photographer willing to put that effort into learning a camera, hence my caveat above. Finally, In my humble estimation DxO Labs was right on the money with their evaluation of the sensor - hightest rating ever for a camera, including Medium format cameras. It is a marvelous tool.Ed Ford","06 22, 2012",A2UVTEQKK2YUNG,"E.

Much like my Galaxy Note 8.0 I am able to use it asmy main machine at and obtain USB OTG+MHL with an adapter I've had. It's also so ginormous that I can just use it outright without a monitor.Pros:- Gorgeous 2560x1600 px, 1280x800 dp screen. Extremely well suited to running two apps side by side and about the size of a sheet of paper. It can do 4 apps in a grid and several pen windows at once. But it really shines when you do two apps side by side. The stock keyboard brings the worst of SwiftKey's auto correct but offers a size / layout that you can type as close to a *real* keyboard as you can ever get on a touch screen. Loss of tactile feel but muscle memory can be retained for the letters and numbers. Likewise the web browsing experience is about as close to a Chromebook Tablet as you can get today, as long as you pull up desktop websites. I love that the screen can also get very dim, not just hyper bright. That helps save power when docked and spares the eyes in a dark room.- Exynos 5 Octa processor delivers great performance. I was perfectly happy with Exynos 4 Quad Prime's performance and this is quite an upgrade in engine and GPU power. Seems like the hardware now supports running all 8 cores at once and independantly but the software still switches between 4 x power saver and 4 x high performance cores. In practice it works great, unlike Tegra 3.- S-Pen makes tablet life better. Between the Note Pro 12.2's giant screen and high resolution, it is a pleasure to write on. I use MyScript Stylus Beta for the best handwriting recogition and more up to date bug fixes than the code Samsung licensed (SwiftKey for kb mode, MyScript for hw mode). It seems to use the same S-pen as the Galaxy Note 3, much as my Note 8 seems to use the one from the Note 2. The new version of S-Note is now superior to the INKredible app available on Google Play, integrates far better with the Android OS, and offers a seamless sync with Evernote when set to use Evernote as the sync account in settings. Apps like Lecture Notes and Papyrus are still worth playing with if you want something less Samsung specific. Also MyScript's Mobile Notes app if you want to write a lot and then convert to text. ArtFlow Studio (raster) and ScribMaster (vector) are better drawing apps than Sketchbook Pro in my opinion but a free version Galaxy edition is bundled. I love being able to write 2 x to 3 x as much in Stylus Beta as my Note 8 could. Plus there is a Samsung feature that lets you pop up a handwriting to text window over any text field, useful if you prefer a custo keyboard app like SwiftKey or Google Keyboard.- Samsung keyboard dock has a MicroUSB 3.0 port for charging, so you can use the same charger as the tablet or a regular MicroUSB 2. No need to carry two chargers. At this size you get a comfortable and full keyboard sans numpad, home/enter/etc clusters (use fn+arrows for home/end/page up/page down). It's more comfortable than a 10.1&#34; like the ASUS Transformer line because no compromises for size were necessary. The kickstand/slot design fits my Galaxy Note Pro 12.2, Galaxy Note 8.0, and my phone just fine. I would like if the keyboard was a bit &#34;Thicker&#34; like my Logitech K810 Bluetooth keyboard or if it had the same 3-device easy switch but it does not. Thicker would be a better typing experience but we all know why they made the dock keyboard thin. At least it is nice and clicky, a decent laptop keyboard.- Using a mouse has improved somewhat. We now can have the full awesomeness of mouse hover working roughly the same as stylus hover (Air View). There seems to be independent settings for turning it on/off for mouse and stylus. Works fine with the cheap Motorola Bluetooth mouse I got off of Daily Steals. Sadly we still can't mouse over on XKCD but stuff like the menu on Amazon works.- USB Ethernet dongles work!!!! For me this is a huge win for using the device at work. Samsung makes an expensive Ethernet+2 port USB2 adapter. I use the USB 2 Ethernet dongle from my old (first gen) Zenbook UX31. Dunno if USB 3 gigabit dongles would work but I assume so. As much as I love my Galaxy Note 8.0 as a daily driver, supporting Ethernet makes the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 a much better device for use at my work place, where Wi-Fi is not always universal.Cons:- Extremely expensive. $749 for 64GB or 32GB+dock on Amazon; or 32GB no dock at Best Buy for almost as much after tax.- It's so big you may find it hard to use as a tablet rather without a desk. I'd highly reccomend a case that can prop it up at a better typing angle or even a Breffo Spiderpodium. Keyboard docks from Samsung and Zagg are simple kickstand like docks not a clamshell like the ASUS Transformer dock. Logitech and various cheap case manufacturers off case+keyboard options too. I use the Samsung dock.- It won't charge from any of my powered MHL 1.1 adapters for Galaxy S3 / Note 2 / Note 8 devices. But it still puts out the video signal just fine. Perhaps a MHL 2.0 adapter for Galaxy S5 / Note 3 will work.- While Android handles keyboard and mouse input very well, developers do not test with these. Google in particular tends to break ctrl+arrow and mouse wheel support in their apps whenever custom views are used. Which  in Google and Samsung apps are very often.Neutral Issues:- There are several preloaded apps like the NYTimes, Netflix, Evernote, and remote meeting stuff. But many of Samsung's usual TouchWiz apps are not present. You have to download them. Most people are not gonna miss apps like ChatOn. You get a much more minimalist feature set than say, a Galaxy S phone but you usually keep good stuff like swipe to screen shot.- At 32GB the size of TouchWiz is not a big issue. You can still expect a good 22~23 gigs or more of storage space. You can stick an epic sized MicroSD card in and get Apps2SD. Writing to MicroSD or USB drives requires using the stock files app, making apps use their own directories on the media (e.g. /storage/$device/Android/data/$packagename), or rooting. You can get USB OTG 2 and 3 cables and plug in a bloody 1TB drive with more functionality than Nexus devices have without root.- The latest version of Android rarely matters anymore unless you are an obsessive compulsive. All the real goodies are in Google Play Services and related Google magic. Most things that matter are APPS. Which is good because Samsung probably takes twice as long to update their tablets as they do phones. This device costs so much and is niche enough that the custom ROM scene at XDA is dead.- Battery life and charging times could be better if you're used to an older Transformer that had a battery in the keyboard dock. But it ought to easily last 6-8 hours of dependable use, probably 2-3 days if you don't use the tablet heavily all day long. You'll likely want to leave it charging overnight or from dinner until bed.- The back is a faux leather styled plastic like a Galaxy Note 3. It feels like good plastic, unlike the Galaxy S3 and Nexus 5. Also the tablet is so darn big you can easily ignore the fake stitchy look at the edges on the back. You may or may not like the look but it's easy to ignore and feels fine in hand. If you want the feel of leather, get a case.All in all, I like it very much for handwriting, browsing, and as a secure shell terminal. My HP11 Chromebook was only good at the last of those.","07 18, 2014",A2SQJ8TORLLM46,"Terry Poulin ""Spidey01""",68.0,"Awesome for handwriting, webbrowsing, and working with a keyboard and mouse",6.0,587.0,1405641600.0,1423.0,35.0110643285,17.0957719902,17.9152923383,0.0843806344418,0.0,0.872893140518

I'm not an Apple hater by any means, I own a MacBook Pro, and iPod Touch, Airport Express and my wife has an iPod.I ripped my ~300 CD collection using Apple lossless on iTunes. I say this because I'm about to bash the iPad a little bit.The iPad does what it's designed to do flawlessly (as most Apple products).  The problem is , -what- it's designed to do.The iPad, IMHO is not designed to be a standalone computer. As soon as you take it out of the box it prompts you to plug it to your PC.You can't transfer music or movies without iTunes.  You can't connect USB mass storage for that.  The only source for Applications is the App store.Most people defend this position by Apple by saying that it helps preserves the quality of the user experience, and while this is true, it's only part of the story.It's also about controlling the revenue flow (just google i""in App purchases)Then there is the Flash story.  Just see part of the Web.  Yes, Flash it might be outdated, slow, buggy, etc, but I think that taking the choice away from the consumer is not a good thing.There is also lack of Java support.  So while the iPad is a great device, i feel it's a little bit restrictive for me.  It's probably the BEST choice for MANY people, might be for you, but not for me, so I sold it.--- But I got hooked to a tablet computer ----So i got hooked to using a tablet.  Just touch the screen and immediately see the weather, e-mail or call my relatives using Skype.  Control my music Library remotely.  etc.Battery life is long.  Light and portable.--- What are the alternatives? ----Well, this is the hard part.  After monitoring the offerings for a while, I found that there aren't many.-Netbooks, are based on Windows and x86 architecture.And while not a big fan of Windows, that's not a dealbreaker for me.  However, most NBs are based on Intel Atom, which does not have an important feature for a multimedia device: H264/MPEG4 Hardware decoding.So with such a weak CPU, high bitrate videos are not possible.  There is the recently released AMD C-50 which does that, and there is the iconia w500, but I have my reservations (doesn't seem to be fanless design for example)-Blackberry Playbook / HP Touchpad :  I think it's late for a single vendor supported to come into play.  App availability will be an issue.--- Android Honeycomb with Tegra 2 ---I started reading about Android Honeycomb devices a few months back.  I don't even have an Android phone (I use a company owned Blackberry).So I had to do a lot of reading and talking to people.On paper, it looks great.  So does the Tegra2 System on Chip.Android is based on a linux/unix kernel with optimizations and add-ons by Google.  Anyone who has used Linux can tell how lean the base OS is (so is iOS, BTW)Tegra 2 puts power where it's needed, and keeps the power usage down.  iPad and Tegra is the Revenge of the ARM processor. Reduced instruction set and simplicity for general purpose tasks, combined with dedicated HW for multimedia.It just seems like the right combination.  On paper, at least.  So I decided to try, using the money OI got from my Ipad.--- Why the Iconia A500? ---Wanting a 10"" screen there aren't many choices at the moment.  But I even compared with some of the upcoming tablets specs.The HW and SW is pretty much the same, so at the end the decission was based on minor details (never owned Acer before, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt, being most of the system off-the shelf stuff)ASUS Transformer:  If you are looking for tablets, you know about this one.  ASUS teased us with a very few units, for whatever reason, and it sold out immediately.  It seems to be back in stock through Amazon as I write this.But this doesn't speak well of a HW vendor (hey, it's not the iPad sho sells by millions). Still, the price point is very attractive.  So I was  going to wait until I noticed a very important detail:No USB port (that I could find on the specs/forum, so check by yourself).  This is a mayor flay.  So I keep looking.Motorola Xoom.  I almost got this one.  But $600 is too much and I don't really need the extra 16G (not for an extra $150 compared to the Iconia).I also don't like the fact that it has a non-LED-backlit screen. not for a HIGHER price.  The power connector also looks flimsy, and it's on the bottom of the device (or top if you rotate)It also has a straight connecto which puts more tension on the plug, so in the long term I see it breaking. (The Iconia has the connector on the side while in lanscape mode, and it's an L-shaped connector)Samsung Galaxy 10.1: This one looks sexy, but it's also more expensive and also seems to lack USB port!Toshiba Tablet:  Seems promising but also a tad more expensive and seems thicker.  But this one I also like.  Plenty of connectivity options.  My second choice.So now to the point.--- Iconia A500 Details---The ""Shell"":The case is well built.  It really feels solid and looks nice.  Power connector is on the side (while on lanscape mode) and it's L-shaped to be easy on the plug.The screen is gorgeous,  LED-backlit and with Gorilla Glass.*Connectivity:-Micro USB to connect to your PC-Full size USB to connect to mass storage device (I need to fully test this though).  Thanks.  This should be the norm rather than the exception.-MicroHDMI.-MicroSD (32G):  It would have been nicer a full size SD IMHO.  Haven't used yet.-Wifi + Bluetooth : I could connect my Apple Wireless Keybord with no issue.  Wifi range is good (see ""Software"" for some issue I've seen).  I get stable connection on the second floor with the D-Link router in the basement.-Headphone plug and speakers.  The sound is excellent for a tablet. Really good both from speakers and headphones.-Docking connector: I really don't care about this at the current price of the docking station ($79).  At least Acer doesn't force people to buy it to get USB.- Rear Facing Camera.  Very good for this type of device.  I will not be shooting video of weddings with this thing.  Just the ocassional snapshot.- Front facing Camera:  Here I have a complaint.  Why on earth isn't this thing centered on the top of the screen, instead of on a side.  You need to slightly tilt the tablet to center yourself on the screen while doing video chat.The toshiba has the same annoyance.  Pretty nonsense.- aGPS: Not the best reception.  I had some issues getting the location a couple of times.  Or maybe software issue?  Not sure.*Software - The bad:Well, here is where the trouble starts.  Android is still buggy.  A dealbreaker?  That's a personal thing.  Here some issues I've found.-I got ""no internet connection"" error a few times, even with 3 of 4 bars of signal.  I get the feeling that it's a SW thing, but I can't tell for sure as I haven't called Acer yet or rooted the thing to check myself.But I have seen this issue reported with the Xoom as well, so I tend to believe it's SW.-Youtube HD playback stutters a little bit.  Not much, but if you're picky, or watching a full length movie, it will be annoying.  I believe there is some application in the background messing up the CPU.It's not the Wireless conenction because it does it even with the playback buffer with plenty of data.  I tried to use the html5 version of YouTube ([...]) but I couldn't confirm it's really playing that version.-The Iconia has trouble sleeping.  It wakes up sporadically, the screen lights up for 3 to 5 seconds, goes back to sleep. Some daemon or service must be waking it up.  Hope I can find which one.-This is probaly not Acers/Google fault, but I use Skype, and I would like to have Video.  I read it's coming.  I hope Microsoft doesn't push it back.I hope these issues get resolved  but in any case, I doubt this will be my main device for movie watching.*Software - The good:- Honeycomb's interface is miles ahead of iOS.  No more restrictions to tiny icons as if it were a phone.  You have widgets you can customize.You can just tab on any snapshot of your favorite sites to launch.  Very customizable in general.- Android market, or any application you wish to download from any source if you so decide to do.  No more iOS protecting me from myself.This comes at a price, off course.  It's easier to get malware.  But you have the choice to stick with the Android market and it should be pretty safe.- Plenty of included utilities: media player, book reader, Documents to Go (haven't fully tested).  I could convert some previously backed up DVDs to play on this device using Handbrake (Free)I still need to tweak the settings more, but this is enough to entertain my toddler for a few hours.- Freedom to tinker with your folders while connected to your computer.- Google navigation: Thanks to integrated GPS, you can download and get directions from Google that work even after you lose your connection.  You can even lose your way a little bit and it will get you back.These are spoken turn by turn.  I hope someone makes a car holder for this thing.  The big map is gorgeous.- My rating: Four startsI have to acknowledge that after a couple of days of use I considered returning this device due to some of the annoyances I described above.But this thing grew up on me, and I decided to keep it.  The above issues seem SW (or bloatware) related, as I have seen them reported on the Xoom as well.  I hope they get fixed.I take one star because of the things mentioned above and because I think Youtube HD should work flawlessly, as it's a Google site, running on Google's browser on Google's operating system on Google blessed hardware.Overall, a nicely priced, well-built, maybe the best tablet option out there IMHO, that suffers from some software issues that will be hopefully resolved over time.I will update this review after a month or so if time allows.UPDATE: Someone pointed out screen is not IPS.  I thought it was.  I corrected that.

It is still more reflective than the Samsung Chromebook, but not as ""glaringly bad""Loathe Lion. The strength of Chrome OS is its boot into exactly where the user leaves it, unless the user explicitly shuts down.  Lion does the same, but actually ""saves the user state"" and returns to where the user was even if the user explicitly shuts down.  Lion tries to ""kill the file system,"" not by actually killing it, but by hiding it from the user.  Chrome OS presumes the user will be tied to Google in the Cloud, and that's where the user's files are.  I much prefer having a file system even if I have to look for my files in the cloudthan one an OS attempts to obscure.Now this isn't about the Air or Lion, but the comments above relate to how I (and why I don't much) use my Chromebook.As you'd expect, the Chromebook Atom processor is just tedious compared to the Air's i5.  It isn't just ""watch paint dry slow,"" it is sometimes jerky and laggy slow.  Even my first computer decades ago didn't lag collecting text as much as the Chromebook does (though that varies unpredictably depending on what I'm doing at the time).Where I'd pick up the Chromebook before the (yes, even though that one wasmuch faster than the CB) older 11"" Air because the Chromebook's screen was less glossy and bigger, I don't do that much when the new less glossy 13 Air is at hand.Fairly recently, Netflix came to the Chromebook.  It is ok, but it sings on the Air.  Even on my Acer Iconia A500 Honeycomb tablet, which received Netflix earlier this week, Netflix seems to have some advantage over the CB.  THAT could be optimization.I'm confident there's a place in the world for Chromebooks, but Google and any company making them needs to improve the hardware.  A lot.  I love the concept, like my Chromebook, but the experience seems clunkier and less welcoming as time passes --- even though to be very honest, Google does keep working to improve the experience, and it has improved.  Which is good, since Apple's Lion has much that's a huge about face). That said, there's not a lot Google can do to overcome the sludge Atom processor.  I'd love to have an EASY install of the Chrome OS on my new MacBook Air, one that wouldn't endanger the Mac OS I use daily for work.  No question, it would zoom on the Air hardware!JUNE 26, 2011Tonight I used the Chromebook to log onto Ustream.tv to watch an interactive podcast with chat.  The Chromebook displayed the video feed from Ustream just fine and I had no trouble logging into the associated chat session simultaneously.  However, the processor/video seem pushed ""too hard"" by the simultaneous video (an Adobe Flash stream) and chat.  The chat feature went into hibernation when I tried to type, which made bi-directional communication very difficult.  I'm pretty sure this is a hardware limit from the gear in the Chromebook.  Still, it is possible that as Google continues to update and optimize Chrome OS it will become faster.I continue to be impressed by the Chromebook's exceptional battery life!ADDITIONAL COMMENTS June 24, 2011Most of the ""problems"" I had with the Chromebook are the differences between the Google Apps account setup we have at work and the regular Gmail account which, strangely, has newer features first.If you have ONE Gmail account, you'll probably find the Chromebook far easier to set up than I did, trying to use it both with my ""Apps"" account and my regular Gmail account.You'll have to decide yourself how important (if at all) it is to have ""local"" music on your computer.  I carry a 16 GB iPod Nano most of the time, so, really, I can live without music on my Chromebook, but that leaves me still needing a computer with iTunes to sync the iPod.  I also have a large SD card in my Nexus One and keep music there.  If you have a connected phone with large storage and access to Amazon Cloud Player (or others) you can possibly get by without a computer to manage LOCAL music and video.EDITED AND EXTENDED June 23, 2011Two weeks ago I set up a buncha' iMacs to replace old Windows machines at a public library.  All in a day's work.The iMacs are great.  But to keep them safe I had to install Faronics Deep Freeze, a program that erases any user changes every time the computer restarts.  Most big computer stores, BestBuy and Apple included) use Faronics to keep customers out of the operating system.)I also had to set the EFI passwords on the iMacs, again, to keep the library's patrons from bringing in an Apple Boot Disk and messing the gear up.* * * * * * * Third Day - the Paragraph Below from the Original Review is WRONG *By contrast, the Chromebook could just be dropped on a table and plugged in, without worry the patrons would mess it up.  Theoretically,  it WOULD be a lot easier to walk out the door with a Chromebook than a 21"" iMac . . .* * * * * * * The Preceding Paragraph is WRONG *[typing WOULD above was my first encounter with the Chromebook's missing CAP LOCK key]That said, the Samsung screen is very nice.  I'm not getting down into ""nits,"" but it has a matte finish, and sitting in the kitchen at home where I have it right beside my glossy screen MacBook Air under fluorescent light, its screen is easier to read . . . NO REFLECTIONS of my shiny nose.  Plenty of resolution.The Chromebook is fast --- enough.  But you have to have reasonable expectations.  The Chromebook is NOT for editing large movie files.  No Photoshop though there is an online photo editing APP.  It works fine to browse the web, and does just great with Google Docs.  Gmail is a delight on the Chromebook, if you delight in receiving and answering email.Of course, no internet, and the Chromebook is pretty much a doorstop.  Wouldn't be a problem at my office, or at the library where I set up the iMacs, or at Starbies.  But there are places the internet is limited, which is why I will be connecting the Verizon 3G which comes with mine, though I view the ""free"" 100 mb as a laughable come on and will be signing up for more.There's idiosyncrasies, and I've not spent enough time to try them all out.  Just a few minutes ago I discovered how the ""new Window"" feature works.  Since the Chrome OS is one page, it can't work like your regular computer.  But there's a window icon, making it possible to, for example, open Gmail in one window, then browse in another.  Click on the window icon, and one browser page slides away and is replaced by another, both fully active.  Think of how smartphone homescreens change at a swipe.  I'm sure I will learn more as I use the Chrome OS, but it is close enough to generic to not present a barrier to anyone getting started.The keyboard is superb, and the trackpad excellent.If you want a (relatively) inexpensive computer and can live within the Google sphere, the Chromebook is worth a look.  The Acer models look to offer more for the $, but without the matte screen, best I can tell, and with shorter battery life.At the library where I installed the iMacs, just think what a great idea a ChromeDesk would be!  Easily controlled through a web interface, and as close to vandal proof an OS as exists.----Third Day Comments.I originally set up the Chromebook with my Google APPs user ID from work.  That account became the ""owner"" which imposed limits because my personal Gmail Account has access to Google Checkout and the extra Picasa Web Album storage I buy.  So I looked on Google's Chromebook help for reset instructions.Simple.  TOO SIMPLE.  Turn off the Chromebook, slide a little hidden switch, turn on the power, and your Chromebook is wiped.  True, someone who steals it can't get your stuff without your password, but they can sure ""own"" your Chromebook as theirs in 10 minutes or less because after the wipe it comes right back as new and ready for a new user to set up.The TOO SIMPLE RESET takes the Chromebook ""off the table"" for consideration as a device for public access.Another issue I realized.  There's absolutely no cross over between user accounts.  Buy an APP or install an extension in one user account, and it is locked / linked to that account only. There's an option to allow multiple log ons, but some features won't work if you do that since Google doesn't know, for example, which Google Talk account should receive messages.  Would take some planning!The ""Guest Account"" is really bare.  Would be nice if Google added the ability for the owner to designate some extensions and even bookmarks which would not be erased every time a Guest Account closes.  That feature would go a long way toward making the Chrome OS computers suitable for public access use.The Media Player is just awful.  My Android phone has 16 GB of SD storage and lots of music, even audio books.  My Android Honeycomb tablet has a 32 GB card, again with local media.  Both have well designed players.  ""  It is not currently set up to encourage local storage, local media, and lacks an acceptable player.The Chromebook is as advertised: ""Nothing But the Web.""Which would be fine on a college campus with ubiquitous FREE WiFI, not so much if you're paying Verizon too much for too little bandwidth.  The Chromebook needs more local storage, and not just an SD card hanging out the front and inviting damage.  The Chromebook needs a good local media player.The Amazon MP3 Cloud Player works just fine, and seamlessly downloaded a song to the Chromebook internal SSD, where the (ugh) Media Player found and played it.Google needed to think this through much as Amazon did the Kindle with its ""free"" 3G service.  It is too bad Google didn't go ahead and buy wireless spectrum.  Whatever cloud model you're going to use, Google, Amazon, Apple, BestBuy, the telcos stand in your way and will be making more money than the gadget makers and service providers.SUMMARY AT DAY THREE:  The Chromebook, at $500, is about 1/3 what I paid for my MacBook Air.  Since I live in the Google-verse most of the time, the Chromebook does most of what I do.  It browses the web, manages my calendar, handles my email.  When Google adds the ability to work on Google Docs, Spreadsheets, Calendar, and Gmail, without a ""live"" internet connection, it will do more.What it doesn't do is handle local media.  It won't sync my iPod or (as far as I know) any other media player.  Printing is possible, but complex at this time.Could I live with just the Chromebook?  Not as I currently live. I'm sure I could load it into a backpack and stream podcasts while I walk, but it is far better to download them to my Mac, then sync to an iPod.I have hopes for the Chromebook.  Go Google!  But I'm pretty sure, for me, it's ""back to the Mac.""

Well, I purchased my first Ipod about 7 months ago.  It was when the 60gb came out.  My old one from Dell was about to crash, and I thought I would go with an IPOD.  I downloaded Itunes, and it easily transfered all my music on my hard drive to itunes with just one click.  All I had to do was install the IPOD software.  That wasn't a big deal either.(This is when I was still using my dell laptop.  I just recently switched to a macbook.  I have now changed sides, and I think I will only get apple computers.  You don't have the headaches at all of managing a PC, for example not worrying about viruses.)  Even with a pc IPOD is so much easier to upload your music, and pictures.  It pretty much does it all automatically when you just plug in the IPOD.  I first had a 60gb in white.  I loved it.  I got white because I heard it showed the fingerprints less.  I disagree with the people who stated that an IPOD is fragile.  I agree it is prone to scratches.  My white one does have some, but not major ones.  I have dropped my white IPOD several times.  Two of the times have been on my tile floor.  And it was still working just fine.  I expected the opposite when I picked it, but I was relieved.  I just purchase a 80gb black one.  I have been using handbrake software to put my dvd movies on my computer so, I can transfer them to my IPOD.  A two hour movie takes about a 1GB of space.  So, I thought the 80 GB would be a nice upgrade.When my black one arrived I was very happy with it.  It looks the same.  I do think it looks better in black.  I have a clear hard case on order so, I don't get scratches on it.  I didn't order it from Amazon.  I got it from Apple because they were offering free engraving for the holiday.  Only took about five minutes to load up my entire Itunes library which was a total of 1009 items, plus 200 photos.  Just pluged it in, and it did everything on its own.  Also, you don't have to get any new accesories if you have a 30gb or 60gb video IPOD.  You can still use your current ones.The menu settings are the same as the 60GB.  It does seem to run a little faster then the 60gb, and the screen is sharper and brighter.  I notice an improvement in the battery life when watching videos and viewing photos.  A nice improvement.  I am not saying however that if you have a older 30gb or 60gb, that it is definiyly has to be replaced with the 80gb.  The only reason I would recommended it is if you think you are going to need more space on the drive.  Or if you are like me, and like to always have to newest model.  I am going to keep my white one as a spare, or incase I have a friend who wants to use it when traveling.  I am going to use the old one to backup my laptop.Now on to my thoughts on Apple.  I have had nothing but great experiance from them.  They are very helpful from my experiance.  As to Itunes, I don't see a downside to having to only use them.  If I find a song I want on another MP3 website that Itunes does't have, I just download it and burn it to a RW disc, then I use Itunes to rip it back on the computer.  Works fine.  Maybe a bit more work, but not a major deal.  Itunes is very good software, and very easy to use.  As with most mac software.Anyway, my babbling is done.  I would highly recommend the 80gb IPOD.  Not a necessity if you already have the older version however.  The improvements are not that great to completly replace a working older version of the Video IPOD.  It just depends on the space needs of the individual.  So, I have now became an loyal apple user, and I will never use another kind or brand of MP3 player.  Thank you Apple for making a great product!","12 21, 2006",A2EHFYSRLY45Z3,"Brandie Woodward ""Spock4Pres818""",58.0,I will always stay with an IPOD.

I think it is really important to rent such a piece of equipment before investing $1700 - $2000 on it. So far, it has not disappointed. I come from a family of crop bodies. I started off in my early days with the XSI. I later upgraded to the T1i, T3i, and 7D. All were improvements of their older siblings. Here are my first impressions of the 6D.PROS:1.) Feel - I read countless reviews saying this was a lightweight camera. In terms of the size, yes it is. Only my XSI is about the same size. My 7D dwarfs it after the battery grip is attached. However, this thing feels solid! The dials are amazing and smooth. The shutter release button is very smooth. I don't think I ever get tired of hearing that shutter sound.2.) Button layout - They hit the nail on the head with this one. Less is more in this case. I never use the LCD screen on top of the body. I always use the menu on the screen to change options. It is just a force of habit. I am not a fan of the ISO button. It is in the center of the LCD panel. I am used to having that button stand out. The added button to lock the mode dial is a great welcome.3.) Viewfinder - It is bright and awesome. Enough said....4.) ISO Performance - Immediately upon getting the camera, I cranked the ISO to 6400. I would NEVER dream of shooting at that ISO with my crop bodies. When I opened up the file in PhotoShop to remove noise, I was blown away. The noise at 100%, on a 5,000 pixel wide image was equivalent to what I see at ISO 400 on a CROP camera. That is nothing! I was finally able to shoot my son in our living room without using the Speedlite. It was a welcome change.5.) Auto ISO - I shot a sunset with it at auto ISO. It never got higher than 5,000 ISO. I didn't need a tripod. If you are savvy in PhotoShop, you can eliminate what little noise there is. I will be using the auto feature a lot.6.) GPS/WiFi - enough has been mentioned. Great features, but battery hogs. I do like the option to send RAW preview to iPad. I will use that this weekend when I shoot some family photos.7.) Built in level - I haven't heard this one mentioned too much. On the back of the LCD screen, there is a level for when you're tripod shooting. This saves up to 10 minutes in post processing having to straighten out horizons that sometimes are at angles. I was using that all morning on the tripod. Just level the head and just adjust the leg height.CONS:1.) RAW file compatibility: Do not be mislead. Only the NEWEST PhotoShop CS6, Lighroom4, PhotoShop Elements 11, and the newest Aperture will read the 6D's raw files. I use CS5. So, does that mean I have to go buy a new version of PhotoShop? No, you have two options here. The first is to use Canon's Digital Photo Professional to open your RAW files and export them to PhotoShop. This process is long and it drains resources. The second option is download the newest version of Adobe DNG Converter. It is a quick process that will take your .CR2 files and make them a .DNG. It compresses the file a tiny bit, but there is NO IMAGE QUALITY LOSS. Now I can use my version of PhotoShop to edit my shots.2.) Battery life - it isn't 700 shots as advertised. I got maybe 500 without using any of the GPS/WiFi functions and not using the LCD screen for previewing. I will get a battery grip.3.) Weight - This a heavy camera. Do not be fooled by the lightweight comments. Compared to beasts such as the 7D and 5DIII, yes, it is light. But after carrying it all day with my 100-400 telescope attached, my shoulders and hands were fatigued.4.) Ergonomics - The small size is also a bad thing. My hands are strained a bit when I grip to press the button. I will have to use the battery grip just so I can have a better feel when shooting with it.You cannot go wrong with this camera. I have only been shooting with it for 24 hours as of now, but I feel like I have been shooting with it for years. It took about one minute for me to get comfy with the buttons and what they do.","04 12, 2013",AIAKCW5R93FAS,Timothy LaBranche,71.0,Amazing Piece of Equipment - Objective Review,11.0,365.0,1365724800.0,789.0,71.0108736044,36.2838734806,34.7270001238,0.0428783879019,0.0,0.873059962864

Basically, I still think the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 is a fantastic tablet.  At current price of $179 it is an amazing value.  Sure, you can get generics for $100 less, but they wind up being a bit of a crap shoot.  I have tried a couple.  I always wind up frustrated because things just don't seem to work they way they should, and it is often difficult or impossible to get firmware/software updates  Then when you do the update process can be complex and scary.  Samsung has been very good about updates.  We even got Jelly Bean a month or so ago.  The update process is dead simple.  You get a notification an update is available then it is delivered wirelessly whenever you are ready.  Other than making sure you have a good battery charge before starting, you don't have to do anything special to update.I do not use any of the Samsung apps like Music Hub, etc.  It would be nice to be able to uninstall them to free up the space, but that is a minor quibble.Another minor quibble is the proprietary dock connector.  I would prefer a standard micro USB port like my Galaxy Note phone.  Oh, well, at least there are relatively inexpensive adapters to allow the use of USB devices.One caveat, the Tab 2 7.0 does NOT have HDMI video out capability (or any other video out that I can tell).  Period.  There is an HDMI adapter for some of the other Galaxy Tabs, but it does not work with the Tab 2 7.0.  I do not really care about this, but if you do, just be aware.  If anyone learns differently and verifies it with personal experience, PLEASE let me know.ORIGINAL REVIEWOK, I have put off posting a review because I thought all of the 5-Star reviews had already raved about the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7 sufficiently.  But I have been seeing too many low ratings that I consider unjustified so here it is.  This is such a great tablet I will simply try to counter some of the major cons that keep coming up.  As background, I have owned or extensively used an iPad, 4 Android tablets, and 4 Android phones.  I do not at all claim to be an expert with Android; I am still a bit puzzled by many things.  But I have used enough Android devices, from 1.6 to 4.0 to have a bit of familiarity with the OS and devices that run it.As I mentioned, I do own an iPad, though my wife has stolen it from me.  I bought the iPad strictly to make sure she would be able to use it easily anyway.  But its loss meant I HAD to get the Android tablet I wanted to begin with, right?  Thank goodness because I am NOT an Apple fan.  Even I, an admitted Apple NON-fan has to admit that Apple devices work and work well.  Even to me, the iPad is the gold standard for tablets.Battery life - this tablet has GREAT battery life, but you do have to practice reasonable power practices.  I charged mine overnight one night, unplugged it in the morning, used it, admittedly very lightly, and after 4 days battery still showed 75%.  I purposely used the tablet very lightly during this time since I was concerned with standby time.  Read Michael S' comment regarding power saving steps here:  http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EL7PM4TA0S2R/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R3EL7PM4TA0S2RWifi - Many have reported wifi issues.  I don't think this tablet has a wifi problem.  In fact, it has the best wifi performance of any Android tablet I have tried, consistently showing at least one ""bar"" more than any other.  If you have wifi issues try powering your router off and on or unplug then re-plug.  I have ATT Uverse, and I have to do this EVERY time I try to connect a new device.  Every new device gets ""Obtaining IP address from..."" or  ""Connected""/""Disconnected"".  Even when I had cable and was able to use my own router I had to do this occasionally.  The Galaxy Tab 2 7 has wifi performance equal to or better than any of the numerous devices I have used.Move apps to SD - No, as far as I have been able to determine you may not be able to move apps to sd even with App2SD or other such app.  But the device seems to have a TON of system space for apps - far more than normal users require.  Older versions of Android set aside System Storage for apps that might be 256, 512, or, if you were lucky, 1024MB.  On the Galaxy Tab 2 apps seem to be installed in general storage.  Apps space appears in the Total Space.  Right now, for instance, my Total Space area says apps are taking 533MB and shows 3.86GB available.  So how much apps space do you need? If you are super-gamer and need a bazillion GB of apps space, then no, this device might not be for you.  So go spend $400-500 on something else.  If you are a mere mortal, like me, I am pretty sure you will be EXTREMELY happy with this device.Oh, yeah, the Tab 2 has only 8GB of internal storage.  I have never cared about internal storage because I immediately stick a 32GB micro SD card in and make sure photos, music, and videos get stored there.  This tablet will accept a USB OTG adapter so you can store unlimited extra videos on flash drives.  Speaking of OTG adapters, you can get less expensive ones, but this one is really neat:http://www.amazon.com/GrayBean-T-Flash-Keyboard-Connection-SamSung/dp/B0072FJEA8/ref=sr_1_cc_3?s=aps&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1336783341&sr;=1-3-catcorrI bought one, and I can attest that it does work with flash drives.  I just got it and I imagine it will do fine with a USB keyboard.  It has THREE USB ports plus slots for SD and other memory cards.  Sorry, haven't tried those yet, either.  It also has a power input jack for supplemental power, but I don't seem to have a plug that fits.  I will do more testing and post a review for that product soon.  I also have this onehttp://www.amazon.com/Black-Female-Adapter-Samsung-Galaxy/dp/B005YWIRBS/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1336783341&sr;=1-2-catcorrand I can attest that it works, too.Oh, it is not yet available on Amazon, but Samsung makes a Book Cover that is the perfect case for the Tab 2.  Just Google Galaxy Tab 2 Case and you will find it.  It adds almost no bulk.  I can still put the Tab in my pocket.  It is a little pricey right now from reputable sources, but if you decide to go with one of the less expensive places make sure they actually have it.  If you dig, many will say deliver something like 6/23.  Just be careful.  Another note on this case - it ""opens"" to the right in portrait orientation but that is so it will open to the top in landscape.  It folds all the way back for one-hand use, and the edges have tacky rubber strips so you can use as a stand at the angle of your choice.  It is very secure as a stand.  Will not slide at all.  CAUTION:  The Book Cover that Amazon has right now is for the original Tab 7.  The back of the Book Cover case snaps on so the fit has to be perfect.  I don't think the Book Cover for the original Tab will fit the Tab 2.  I got mine from OD.This is, hands down, the best basic Android device I have tried.  It is definitely the 7"" tablet I have been waiting for.  Everything works, and works without spending hours researching how to get some feature to work.","05 11, 2012",A39G79LLPG83HZ,Raymond Perry,72.0,PLEASE Restart your router if you have wifi issues,185.0,555.0,1336694400.0,1366.0,57.9714471261,29.2746868346,28.6967602915,0.0520970104492,0.0,0.872849310534

For the past 2 years I have been the proud owner of a 4th generation iPod Touch, which, until now, I thought was a near-perfect product; I thus had the luxury of doing a head-to-head comparison.  Here is what I discovered.SIZE/WEIGHT/DESIGN:  The first thing I noticed is that the new iPod Touch is significantly thinner and lighter.  It weighs only 88 grams according to Apple, and it is only 6 mm thick.  Its edges are not curved/tapered like the 4th Gen Touch.  At first this felt strange, but now I prefer the feel of the new Touch.  The Touch also, obviously, comes in colors.  With the disclaimer that I've only been using it for a day, it seems like the new anodized back is much more durable and scratches much less easily than the chrome on the back of the 4th generation.CAMERAS: The one place that I thought Apple really messed up with the 4th generation was the cameras.  They were added to the 4th generation as an afterthought.  The new iPod Touch, however, has a 5 MP iSight camera with a sapphire crystal outer cover (prevents scratches).  The image quality is exponentially better than the camera on the old touch.  The front camera is also much better than the front camera on the old Touch and is now 720p compatible.SCREEN: As you all probably know, the screen is about a half an inch taller.  Apple has been heavily marketing this, as it included the same bigger screen on both the iPhone 5 and the 5th generation iPod Touch.  The extra .5 inches allows one to watch widescreen content that encompasses the full screen area.  It also allows one to see more emails and whatnot.  However, the really cool thing about the screen is that it is far more vibrant than the screen of the old Touch.  According to Apple, it is 44% more vibrant, and it covers the whole sRGB spectrum.  In layman's terms, that means the iPod Touch can accurately reproduce EVERY color that Hollywood movie cameras can capture.  The old iPod's screen couldn't.  In real-world usage, I've found that the new Touch's screen is far more vivid than my old Touch's screen, which appears to have a blueish hue and doesn't accurately reproduce some colors.  The new screen also seems to perform better when looked at from extreme angles.A5 PROCESSOR / FASTER WI-FI: In the 5G iPod Touch, Apple upgraded the processor chip from the A4 to the A5 and the Wi-fi chip from single-band N to dual-band N.  Theoretically, Apple claims that the processor will be two times faster, graphics up to 7x faster and that the wi-fi will be twice as fast.  In my real-world test of the wi-fi speed, I found that the old Touch had a download speed of about 12 Mbps with a 15 ms ping on my school's wifi, whereas the new Touch reached speeds of 36 Mbps with a 10 ms ping.  I tested this using the SpeedTest App for iOS.  Web pages definitely load faster, IMO.  The faster processor means that apps load faster too.  Naturally, that means that the largest speed increase will be found in processor and graphics-intensive apps that also use Wi-Fi.  In other words, Facebook, Twitter, News Apps, etc.  I tested how fast it took the Facebook App to load and update on both devices.  The 4G Touch took 10.4 seconds.  The 5G Touch took 2.4 seconds.  If I did the math right, that means that the 5G touch opens the Facebook App 77% faster than the 4G Touch.  The CNN App loaded and updated in 2.7 seconds on the new Touch, as opposed to 5.4 seconds on the old one, a 50% difference.  The faster wi-fi chip and processor should also allow  streaming of 720p HD content onto the new Touch, a feature that really wasn't available on the old Touch.ODDS AND ENDS: The new Touch includes a new power-cable connection, called Lightning.  The Lightning Port is considerably (>60%, I'd wager) smaller than the old Dock Connector Port.  This is a welcome change, as I found that the old dock connector port would get all crusty and dirty on the inside - it just seemed to attract the dirt from the inside of my pocket.  The new Lightning Connector is also reversible, which means you will never have to worry about plugging it in right side up.  The faster processor and wi-fi of the new Touch allowed Apple to enable Siri on the iPod Touch.  This feature is NOT available via upgrade on older iPod Touches.  I really like Siri and find her useful, so this was a welcome addition though please note that Siri ONLY works when you have an active wi-fi connection.  Apple added a small LED flash for the camera - this was a nice touch and seems to work well as long as the object you are trying to photograph is fairly close to you.  They also added a little ""hidden button"" that you can press to attach an included wriststrap to the Touch.  This is really quite useful, as anyone with a propensity for dropping their iPod Touches (like my younger sister :) can tell you.  Finally, Apple included a new type of earbuds - called EarPods - with the new iPod Touch.  These both sound and fit my ear MUCH BETTER than the old Apple Earbuds.  Honestly, they sound well enough that I've been alright with wearing them for light usage (i.e. - walking to the mailbox) when before I would have worn my Beats by Dre Studio headphones.  The Beats are much better, don't get me wrong, but sticking in the EarPods is quicker and easier if I just want to take a quick stroll around the neighborhood.CONCLUSION: The new iPod Touch is not an incremental upgrade.  It is a giant leap for iPod-kind.  The iPod has long had a lock on the MP3 Player market.  Even though it is now two years old, the iPod Touch 4th Generation still is a great product and arguably the second-best MP3 Player on the market.  However, the iPod Touch 5th Generation has dethroned its predecessor as the BEST MP3 Player on the market with gusto.  It is a far and away better product.  Apps load twice as fast.  Internet content loads twice as fast.  The interface is far more fluid and responsive.  The screen is far more vibrant; According to Chris Heinonen, AnandTech's resident screen geek, the screen on the iPhone 5 and the 5th generation iPod Touch has better color accuracy and grayscale-reproduction than ANY monitor or TV of ANY SIZE that he has EVER tested, save for one $20,000 projector.  Before I got the 5th generation iPod Touch, I was perfectly content with the screen on my 4th generation iPod Touch.  Now, as I look at them both side-by-side, the screen on the old Touch looks like a piece of garbage (keeping it PG-13 here :).  The cameras on the new Touch blow the old Touch's cameras OUT OF THE WATER.  In addition to being thinner, lighter, and available in six different color options (Pink, Yellow, Blue, Silver, Black, Product RED), the new iPod Touch is made out of more durable and scratchproof anodized aluminum and just looks and feels like a higher-quality more professional product.  The degree of refinement in this product makes me feel like my old 4G iPod Touch is a cheap kid's toy inferior in every way - speed, build quality, and feature-set.  I am really impressed that Apple, a company that has had a virtually uncontested corner on the MP3 Player market for almost a decade, continues to innovate at such a high level.  I'd give this product 6 out of 5 stars if I could!","10 13, 2012",A1U6ZZ9V2KAEXX,Andrew S.

I was not expecting to replace it until the 4k TVs dropped in price significantly and the 4k content expanded. When this TV came out, I read/watched some reviews on it and thought it would be a great replacement for my TV... I was thrilled when I was able to get my hands on one.Construction: 3/5 starsOut of the box, the TV is easy to set up. It looks very sleek and the thin border has it barely taking up much more room then my 46"" TV did. Upon closer inspection, some flaws were evident: the frame is cheap looking and has sharp, unrefined edges... it also has a high gloss finish and reflects background light. This is not a problem for when I watch movies with the lights out or during the daytime, but when the lights are on, depending on where you're sitting, it can be a tad bit distracting. Overall, minor complaints since this TV is far cheaper then other 4k TVs, so I had some flexibility.Remote: 0/5 starsThe remote, if seen in pictures, seems like a pretty standard remote... however, when I had it in my hand, I realized I was very wrong... the remote is more like a miniaturized version of a standard remote. It's TINY... smallest remote I own, despite the fact that it has a LOT of buttons. The buttons are small and I find myself constantly hitting two buttons at the same time by accident. The problem is, NONE of my equipment has codes for Seiki products, so none will work with the set. I need to keep the remote nearby to adjust the volume which is extremely inconvenient. If that's not all, the remote itself doesn't work right. It may work ok for a while, but out of nowhere it'll turn the TV off when I hit 'mute', or turn the mute on and off repeatedly when I tap the 'volume up' button. Then, a few minutes later, it'll work fine again. This occurs even with all other remotes removed from the room to assure that one was causing a disturbance.Finally, my Verizon Fios remote cannot be used near this TV, which is a MAJOR problem since I obviously use Fios as my TV subscription. Press the arrow buttons, guide button, channel up/down button, etc, and the volume will go up a notch each time... it's maddening. I have NEVER experienced such bizarre problems with remotes before, and I've owned a LOT of equipment and a large variety of remotes.Features: 3/5 starsI have a hard time complaining about the lack of features because I knew beforehand that it was a 'bare-bones' TV... the options were extremely limited in order to account for getting a cheap 4k TV. I did not realize how 'bare-bones' it was... picture and audio options are ultra-basic.Picture: 3/5 starsWhen I first got the TV, I placed it side-by-side with my 46"" Sony and hooked them both up to my HDMI dual-output Oppo Blu-ray player. Now, the picture isn't quite as sharp as my Sony, however I was not expecting 4k results from upscaling. My disappointment was with the color... no amount of adjusting with the TV's limited color controls could make the picture look as good as my Sony. Get the colors to a decent level and the dark areas lost nearly all detail... adjust the dark areas to get more detail, and the lighter colors looked bleached. I spend over an hour fiddling with the controls and finally came up with a compromise, but it was no where near as good as my Sony TV.One thing I didn't consider is the fact that my TV subscription still has numerous channels that aren't digital HD... these standard def channels end up being upscaled so much in order to watch on a 4k TV that the quality is terrible. I'm not sure if all upscaling systems will result in the same poor quality, but I certainly plan to consider this when I get another 4k TV in the future. If necessary, I'll wait a few more years until all channels are available in digital HD.Motion-wise, side-by-side with my Sony, I played the first 'Lord of the Rings' movie and immediately noticed a difference. Scenes looked fine if they were relatively still, however when the camera was panning across an area, my Sony displayed it perfectly smoothly, while the Seiki looked a bit odd... unnatural. The problem here was it was very obvious and distracting at times.As for displaying 4k content, I have a Denon receiver and Oppo Blu-ray player, both of which upscale to 4k. Testing out both independently, I was not able to view 4k content on this TV... nothing but static, distorted images and flashing.Audio: 0/5 starsThe sound from this TV is absolutely awful. First, the volume can be adjusted from 1 to 100... at level 1, the sound is quite loud (volume is muted one step down at level 0). When in my living room alone when it's quiet, it's just way too loud. This is a very strange problem I have never encountered before. I own 6 other flatscreen TVs and I've had countless other TVs, both flatscreen and CRT, and have never had a TV that you simply can't turn down. Using a sound meter, I measured the Seiki TV from 3' directly in front of the screen and it was between 55 dB and 60 dB with the sound at level 1, the lowest it will go without muting. My Sony TV, which also has a 1-100 scale volume control, had to be on level 27 to reach the same volume level as the Seiki.Second, the audio quality is terrible... sounds worse then the speaker on my laptop... very much like the sound is coming through a tin can. I've played with the audio settings quite a bit and found no resolution to the problem.--------------------------Problem Resolution:I wrote to Seiki Digital's customer service department concerning the three main problems at the time: The problems when using my Fios remote, the extremely loud volume, and the 4k input troubles. For the remote, I was simply told that there's nothing they can do about the interference. As for the volume issue, I was told to place a 'towel or piece of cardboard' behind the TV to reduce the 'echo'. Seiki Digital suggested that the problem was my room as it's probably echoing, however my living room has various furniture, carpet, and acoustic panels... there is absolutely no echo. This is also the fourth TV I've had in that same room, and I've never had a TV that can't be reduced to a whisper.As for the 4k input problem, I was sent a link to updated software for the TV. After successfully updating, it did not resolve the issue. This is extremely odd as I noticed another reviewer here was able to run their Oppo player through this TV.I wrote to Seiki a second time, this time mentioning the crazy remote and updating them on the fact that I still cannot watch 4k content. I have not heard back from them yet, but I'll update this review when I do. I have little hope in resolving these issues since if there's anything wrong with the TV, as the warranty states, the cost of shipping it back will come out of my pocket ($110 via UPS), and I have no intention of doing so. I'd rather leave it as it is... there's really no guarantee they can even fix it since they don't seem to consider any of the issues I'm dealing with as actual 'problems'.--------------------------In the end, this was certainly no competition for my 46"" Sony, so I moved it to my bedroom. I purchased a sound bar, turned the audio on the TV off, and placed a piece of electrical tape over the remote sensor. I have to manually turn the TV on and off now and use a separate remote to adjust the volume, but it's at least useable now.As much as I was looking forward to getting this TV, I'm extremely disappointed at what I received. As a TV, it's barely useable as intended. Worst TV I've ever owned. It also made me realize what my minimum expectations are when it comes to TVs... I would never again get a TV that had bare minimum features for supposed 'cutting-edge technology'.--------------------------UPDATE: I originally gave this TV two stars, however nearly a year later I've decided to remove one star. In addition to the sound bar that I purchased to deal with the sound issues, I've also had to purchase a programmable remote to deal with the remote issues that cause bizarre behavior with this TV. This does not solve all the problems as I cannot shut the audio off entirely... turn the volume all the way down, and it's back on when you turn the TV off and on again. Plug a device into the 3.5mm headphone output and the volume will go off, but you have to disconnect and reconnect the connection EACH TIME you power on the TV, otherwise the volume is back on. The number of bugs and quirks with this thing is extraordinary.In the last 9 months, my blu-ray player and receiver has received two updates and even my 5-year old Sony TV received two updates to fix very minor problems... this TV, with all its various problems and bugs, has not received a single update. I check Seiki's website regularly and there's still nothing. Strange since I've had to deal with more bugs with this TV then any other electrical device I've ever owned, and the internet is buzzing with demands for the company to fix various other issues I haven't even experienced yet. I've sent three support requests to Seiki, only the first was responded to with useless information. Clearly a terrible TV with no support by the manufacturer.","07 12, 2013",ASY25YMTIC2A9,Steve,58.0,Terrible TV... plagued with problems,43.0,609.0,1373587200.0,1757.0,30.4533328964,15.6459162322,14.8074166642,0.100370852982,0.0,0.872849348167

I come from a heavy iOS/OSX background owning Ipad3,ipad Mini and Macbook air. This is my first Android tablet . I also own a Sony Xperia Ray android phone but use it mainly as phone. I also bought Xperia Tablet Z recently and had to return due to build issues after few weeks .. I won't get into specs or detailed reviews ( there are quite a few good ones out there) but will list out why i chose Galaxy Note 8.0Build : Everyone is complaining about the plastic build of Galaxy note 8. It is actually very solid and has no squeaks. The backplate gives a little when you push it. However most will use a case to put their tablets so this is a non issue. the white plastic looks classy. Also as this is plastic the Wifi and bluetooth connections are solid. I get min 4 bars even in bedroom with router in living room. Compared this to ipad mini barely went upto 2 bars. Sony Xperia Tablet z was terrible ..It dropped connections so often it was unusable . However not a big fan of where power button and vol buttons are . I would have preferred  power button on top and vol button on left so when i hold tablet they don't get pressed accidentally as this tablet is designed to be held in portrait mode. Also love the physical home button ( I think this because of habit i guess all Apple devices have them :) ). This tablet also weighs as much the ipad mini and Xperia tablet Z so it is very lightweight and easy to hold in one hand for long hrs.Display : Even though the display is 1280x800 the display is very crisp. Movies and pictures look really great and text looks real good at decent reading distance. The display is way better than Ipad Mini but little bit lower than Xperia tablet Z which is 1080P. However i prefer the Galaxy note 8.0 display as it is easy on eyes. The colors popped so much on Xperia tablet Z it hurt my eyes. Small text ( try msn.com website) looks bit bad when you look closely . But you would never use tablet close to eyes anyways.Battery life : I get about 2-3 days on single charge with moderate use browsing internet, watching YouTube, some games etc. Mind you I keep brightness to 25% , Bluetooth and GPS off , app notifications off. This decent but not as good as iPad mini.SDXC card extension : This was the biggest sell for me. I bought a Sandisk 64 GB class 10 SD card and put about 40 movies on it and my books and i am all set for long trips. None of the ipads have the feature.Non Propriety port: The charge port is micro USB. So with my universal USB charger i just need to carry one cable that will allow me to charge my MP3 player, my tablet, my cell phone and my portable amp as all use micro usb port. Reduced the clutter of cables i need to carry when i travelForm factor : I was a big fan of Ipad mini for its form factor. I tried to use 10.1 inch tablet ( Sony Xperia Tablet Z) even though light became cumbersome after holding in hand for more than 30 mins. The 7 inch is too small , 10.1 inch too big , 8 inches just perfect for both reading books and watching movies. However i do prefer the 4:3 format of Ipad  mini Vs 16:9 format of Android tablets.Multi tasking : This is brilliant feature and this device allows to have two applications next to each other . This is good when you want to take notes and when browsing a website or a doc . Also the performance is so good there is zero lag even with 6 applications open in background. Ipad doesn't have true multi tasking and there was lag on Sony Xperia tablet Z even though it is high powered device. However that may be due to Sony's bad skinning of jelly beanPerformance/Touch Wiz : Samsung has heavily skinned jelly bean with touch wiz. However there is no lag as this tablet has gobs of power . The 2 GB RAM and quad core processor keep this humming along. I had sometimes 6 applications running in background which were cpu heavy but no lag or abrupt app closures. With Ipad mini apps sometime closed abruptly due to aggressive memory management. iOS is one of the best tuned OS and uses the HW properly . Android still needs horse power to run smoothly.Speakers : They are placed in the same way it is on ipad mini. I like that because when i watch movies in landscape mode the sound is more rounded as my palms cup them. The are loud but not quite as loud as Ipad mini but way better than the ones on sony Xperia Tablet Z. The sound is loud enough to hear in a noisy env. I will not use the tablet for music as i have a very good Sony mp3 player with amp .. So the speakers are only for you tube videos or movies . Mostly i will use headphones anywaysIR blaster : IMO this is just a gimmick. The Watch on and Peel work for me only if i point my tablet at  proper angle to the device it is controlling. The app has so little features. The one implemented on Sony Xperia Tablet Z is awesome. It recognized all my HT components complex menu options and controlled them without me having to point the tablet accurately at the device . However i am hoping someone will come up with an awesome remote appS Pen : This feature is new to me so i am completely fascinated by the tech. It recognizes my handwriting well and i am using it regularly for my meetings ( Handwriting to text mode) . Need to play lot more with it but love the ability to do this . Not many tablets have thisPrice : I think it is reasonably priced ( I bought mine for $379) for features and functions it provides. people don't seem to mind exorbitant prices apple charges for their devices because they are cool :) . Spen , SDXC extension, touchwiz all makes this tablet worth every pennyEcosystem and OS : Android OS is not as polished as iOS even in its current Jelly bean format . However it is more fluid than ICS. As to apps there are quite a few now in play store that are designed for tablets. Luckily for me all the apps i use i found them in play store . Also android is more open . So it allows me to manage my files the way i want and also root the device if i choose to. It is open to other ecosystems like Amazon market place so i am not tied down to a single ecosystem. This is huge benefit as i was tired of Apple restricting everything to iTunesCameras: I will use them only for skype so no issue with the ones on the tablet. Will never use the back camera for taking pics so it doesn't matter to me what quality pics it takes. however what ever pics i took for testing were decentThings i didn't like : The backbutton and multitask button are so sensitive that when watching movies i have accidentally swiped them and it went back to home page. there is no easy way to disable this . Also not a fan of the location of power button or vol rocker. However the samsung galaxy book cover case is alleviating this a bit ..Overall it is a very solid tablet filled with ton of features and at reasonable price(IMO) on a very flexible and open ecosystem . You just can't beat that. Also it is way better than iPad mini (IMO)..","06 28, 2013",A16ESSU7FFQ09R,animalsrush,73.0,The reason i bought Galaxy Note 8.0,475.0,542.0,1372377600.0,1337.0,28.4710016263,14.3381797193,14.132821907,0.105880734344,0.0,0.872813854044

To my shock, it was amazingly fast compared to last Friday 10/25/2013.  Why?  I think that the two software updates that the tablet received needed a factory reset to actually take advantage of the updates.After the factory reset, the tablet is much more stable and is quicker than the 2012/2013 model.  Moving forward, I will retract my first review and expand it.  I want to thank those that participated in the discussion; their feedback and suggestions helped me to give this tablet another try.This review will be broken up to various sections.  They include: applicability of technical specs, applicability of software features, Samsung perks, UI, physical attributes, and the upgrading process.Applicability of Technical Specs:2560X1600 Screen:This screen is very bright, brilliant, and sharp.  It's actually one of the best screens I have ever seen on a tablet.  It actually blows the N8000s screen away.  Its very easy on the eyes while browsing the internet, reading a book or watching a movie.4 core 1.9 GHz Processing Power with 3gb of ram:The tablet can handle close to any application that is thrown at it.  After the updates and factory reset, S Note imported the entire 56 page pdf while the N8013 was still importing slide 17 of 56.  While playing graphically intense games, the tablet is smooth as butter.  When switching between apps and screens, the tablet does so rapidly with no lag.8220 mAh Battery:The original N8013 had around a 7000 mAh Battery and use to last all day.  However the increased processing speed and screen capabilities may draw excess power from the 2014 note's 8220 mAh battery.  So far, the Note 2014 has decent battery life.  The screen has been on for 7 hours and 43 minutes.  While the screen was on, I was taking notes with Lecture Notes for about 4-5 hours.  I spent about 30 minutes using Handy Scanner, an app that takes photos of documents and imports them into pdf files.  Also, I sent a lot of emails and uploaded a lot of files to to my Google Drive.  the brightness level of the screen was about 20% which is really bright in a lit room.  The battery is at 14%.  I got up at 6:00 am and started using it.  It is now 9:26pmRear 8 MP Camera:The camera is an upgrade over the 5MP camera on the N8013, however because the screen has a really good resolution, it seems to make the picture seem worse than it is.  I have this effect on my desktop computer with two monitors, bad pictures look better on the screen with the poorer resolution.  Anyhow, objectively, the camera is just like the ones from last year's cell phones.  The added flash is nice to have because a lot of tablets seem to leave this essential feature out.Capacity:Either you have the 16 GB or the 32 GB version; I'm pretty sure you know the benefits of both.  However its important to note that the 32 GB version leaves around 25 GB of actual space to use.  With the N8013, I never filled up the flash drive despite having close to 1000 songs, 200+ photos, and a years worth of lecture notes and document files.  However, usage patterns do vary; if you are the type of person that likes large games, then you could certainly get the 32 GB model of the device and then store extra content on a 64GB micro SD card.Applicability of Software Features:S Note:The main critical point of the 1st edition of this review revolved around S Note and the lag; S Note and the slow performance are the main reasons that I bought the tablet; the initial experiences ruined this tablet for me.  However, THE FACTORY RESET CLEARED UP ALL OF THE LAG/INSTABILITY IN S NOTE AND SYSTEM WIDE.S Note has a new interface that really contrasts with previous versions of S Note.  Shape and Formula Match have been separated from the main tool bar and included under the heading transform, the icon that resembles the cloud.On first thought, this seems innovative, however compared to the old version of Shape Match, this process can be counter productive.  For instance, on the old version, one could just select the shape match tool and then draw the shape.  If unhappy with the shape, the user could simply press the undo arrow and try again.  However, on the new version, you must write the text first and then transform it into a shape or text via the selection tool.  If you make a mistake, you must press undo and fix the thing that you were trying to transform.  This feature is annoying and counter productive in my opinion.  I frequently take Cornell notes where you draw a line down the middle of the paper, closer to the left side of the sheet.  With the new set up, I have two extra steps, I have to draw a line and then draw a free form or rectangular box around the imperfect line that I drew just to turn it into a straight line...As far as having Wolfram Alpha solve equations directly through S Note, some users have reported that its imbedded in the keyboard some where.Concerning old .snb files, the tablet does not support them on the fly, but it CAN convert them to the new format.  After the factory reset, the tablet is quicker and more stable at converting the .snb files; there have been no crashes during conversion.First glance, the previews to notebooks are gone on the new version of S Note.  The previews to the notes have been replaced with realistic looking book covers.  If you once depended on looking at the note in order to easily find it, think again; to get a preview, you must drag the icon down towards the bottom of the screen.There are more advanced templates available on the device; they actually look pretty nice.  Instead of calling home made templates ""templates,"" the device has a feature to import a photo to be used as a background for notes; this is better than nothing.As far as sync accounts within S Note, Google Drive seems to be missing as an option.  If there is a way to add it, please someone respond so that I can edit this.  In the mean time, I will look for a solution.  Currently on the 2014 model, Sync options include the Samsung Account and Evernote.Writing with the new S pen seems smoother and better, however that's due to the increased friction.  The increased friction seems to slow down writing a little, but an after market pen or more use may rectify this problem.[Edit: S Note Conversion/Import/Export File Sizes and Time to CompleteIF the relationship between file size and import/export/conversion time is linear, these results should be able to be generalized to your hypothetical 50,000KB files.My test file was a 16,314 KB pdf. To import the file, it took 197 seconds; this substantially quicker than the N8013. For your hypothetical file of 50,000 KB, the import would take around 10 minutes or 603.78 seconds IF the relationship is linear.This same 16,314KB pdf translated into a 59.74MB .spd S Note file once it was imported without any annotations. It took 40 seconds to export this file to a pdf document. For your hypothetical file of 50,000 KB, the pdf export should be around 122 seconds or 2 minutes.As far as converting .snb files to the new .spd format, the relationship seems to be 2 and a half minutes/80,000KB .snb file.]Multiview:Multiview is still here on the 2014 note.  Its useful but it doesn't use the same intuitive methods as the N8013 does.  Simply tapping on the icon for Multiview does not launch it along side another window, you must drag it over.I as well as other users initially reported that there is no pin window feature.  Upon further exploration, this is not true.  It is accessible from the Air View window; you must draw a space for the application and then select from the limited supply of apps including; calculator, alarm, You Tube, contacts, ChatOn, Hangouts, and internet.  In my opinion, this is counter productive in comparison to the old simple pin window button.Browser:The default browser has trouble with saving .ppt and .doc formats.  I went to blackboard and tried to download a .ppt for viewing and Polaris 5 wouldn't open it.  Using the Blackboard app rectified this occurrence.  I have not tested with Chrome yet.Polaris Office:Polaris Offcice is a great alternative to Microsoft Office for editing or creating documents on the fly.  I mainly use Polaris for converting powerpoints to pdf so that they can be imported to S note.  Polaris 5 can also be used for direct pdf and powerpoint annotations; this method does not seem to support palm rejection, but it's still very useful for those that follow slides, type notes on slides and do light annotations to the slides.Watch On:This is a great TV guide like application.  The bonus is that it uses the built in IR blaster.  This is a cool feature if you are missing the remote or want to impress friends.My Magazine:This is a great media hub for news.  If you follow world news, you can have a great deal of information in this one app.Sketchbook For Galaxy/ Photoshop Touch:Sketchbook For Galaxy is a great alternative to the missing Photoshop touch.  The sketchbook app provides an experience even closer to the real Photoshop desktop app.Samsung Perks:[Retrieved 10/27/2013 12:50 Central Time]""Get a $50 credit for music, movies and TV shows through Samsung Hub and a $25 credit for games and apps through the Google Play(tm) Store.

There are some things that touchwiz does better and some things that it does worse.  All I can say is that the settings section is very confusing.  For example, Samsung even hid the developer options; they can only be unhidden by tapping the build # a number of times...Coming from the N8013's simplistic nature can be kind of harsh, but it is certainly doable.  Read the user guide or google the answers to your confusion.Physical Attributes:The tablet aesthetically is really nice on the eyes.  I always thought that the original N8013 was a little homely.  I'm not sure why the ""pleather"" (plastic leather) look has people complaining.  I think it looks nice.I do not like the capacitive buttons nor the home button on the bezel.  It becomes cumbersome to hold  the tablet in portrait mode; sometimes your hand may hit one of the capacitive buttons or it may be awkward to intentionally use them while the device is in portrait mode.  I have always found the softkeys that rotate with the screen better.  In addition, I don't like the feel of the home button, it seems like it may degrade over time; in my opinion, the less physical buttons, the better.  The iPhone, iPad, and iPod  home buttons of earlier generations seem more sturdy than button on the 2014 note; this may not be true, it's just a subjective thought.The S Pen tip certainly feels better on the screen compared to last year's model.  In addition, the S Pen seems even more comfortable to write with despite its skinny nature.  Another bonus is that it doesn't require a special rotation to get the S Pen into the stylus holder slot.Concerning weight and thinness, the tablet does look cooler than the previous edition, but if you are highly protective of the device and put it in a case, all of that really doesn't matter.The shift from Samsung's special usb cable is really nice.  Now, the tablet can interact with the USB cables that our smart phones have been using for years!Upgrade Experience:There are a lot of things that the tablet does that are similar to the N8000s, however there are a lot of things that are different.  There will be a learning curve and importing your old notes to the new note is not as straightforward as it could be.  However, the improved processing speed and screen are very compelling reasons to get this tablet.As of now, I officially recommend this tablet to new users or people that upgrade from a previous generation note.Again, I must reiterate  that after the factory reset, the tablet is much more stable and is quicker than the 2012/2013 model.  Moving forward, I want to thank those that participated in the discussion because their feedback and suggestions helped me to give this tablet another try.BEFORE BASHING THE TABLET AND INITIATING A RETURN PROCESS, TRY A FACTORY RESET AFTER THE UPDATES; I learned my lesson lol","10 26, 2013",A3ESHZJWEF9R9E,"Lago ""Lagoboss""",88.0,"After Upgrades and Factory Reset, the Tablet is Not as Bad as it Seems",30.0,852.0,1382745600.0,2324.0,34.1360787761,16.9375657471,17.198513029,0.087439080343,0.0,0.872923173511

As of 03/03/2014 my 7D is still working perfectly, and only has slight cosmetic wear on the mode dial, where the rubberized coating is coming off.  The camera is a bit over 4 years old at this point and I still love it.)The Canon EOS 7D is Canon's semi-pro / enthusiast digital crop sensor SLR.  It's a terrific SLR that shines in photo quality, control placement, speed, and viewfinder size and coverage.First, let me tell you a little about myself so you can gauge what my expectations for the camera are.  I'm strictly a hobbyist photographer and use my camera a couple of times a month at museums, outdoor parks, and vacations.  Besides photos of my dog, my photography consists primarily of static subjects.  This is my second SLR.Enough of me, onto the camera.  The 7D is a fairly bulky SLR and dwarfs ""entry level"" models such as the Olympus E-510 (see my photos), though it's no bigger than Nikon's D300s.  With that said, it's not uncomfortably large and is easy enough to carry around all day.  Build quality is terrific and the camera has a solid, luxury feel to it.  The 7D fits very well into my average sized hands and, with the kit 28-135 lens, is nicely balanced.  All the buttons are easy to reach and, if you've used a Canon camera before, easy to figure out.  The magnesium body is sealed against moisture and dust.  The shutter button is well placed and has a nicely defined halfway point.  A control dial is on the back of the camera and behind the shutter button too.  There is also a joystick-like toggle on the back of the camera as well.A large (3"") and high-resolution (920,000 pixel) screen is on the camera back with a secondary status LCD display on the top (with backlight).  The screen is a pleasure to use when reviewing images for focus, and when manually focusing in magnified live view mode.  Compared to the 3-inch 420,000-pixel screen on my Panasonic LX3 it's a definite upgrade, and makes a noticeable difference.The viewfinder is huge and bright and has 100% coverage.  Coming from the Olympus, which has a very cramped and tunnel-like viewfinder, it was a revelation, and was one of the reasons I decided to step up to the 7D.  Also, by using a transmissive LCD on the viewfinder the only markings you see until you confirm focus are for the selected focus method (for instance, a single box when using one focus point, or brackets when using the auto select autofocus method).  Moreover, a composition grid can be imposed on the viewfinder.  The information display on the bottom of the viewfinder is large and bright and contains lots of shooting and camera information.  (Update 05/27/2013: Since I've been trying to shoot manual focus more, I've noticed that the 7D will light up the focus boxes as you manually focus to let you know what part of the scene is currently in focus, at least it does when using Canon lenses.  I can't comment on other lens brands since I only own Canon lenses.  The 7D's huge viewfinder makes it easy to manually focus.)The camera is very responsive and turns on almost instantly.  The sensor cleaning occurs when you turn the camera on or off but can be interrupted during power up.  Focus speeds with the kit lens are very speedy, even in dim light (two 40 watt lamps and a television as the only light sources in a 17' x 11' room).  The 19-point all cross type autofocus is uncanny at picking the correct subject.  If it doesn't get it right the first time it will the second.  I usually set all my cameras to center point autofocus, but the 7D does a great job picking out the subject, so I leave it on fully automatic mode (unless I'm using the 50mm f/1.4 lens, since wide aperture lenses like that can focus shift with such a shallow depth of field).  Live view focusing is not a quick, especially in low light, and I only use live view when I need to shoot at a weird angle and I can't shoot looking through the viewfinder.  Live view can be used with a mirror flip or contrast detection.  The contrast detection mode is fairly pokey, while the mirror flip mode is quicker, but introduces a brief break in the view.  Continuous shooting is available in both a high and a low setting.  High is 8 FPS, while the low speed is 3 FPS.  The shutter sound is nicely subdued and not nearly as noisy as the Olympus' is.Photo quality is terrific.  There are various Picture Styles you can choose to alter the contrast, sharpness, color tone, and saturation of the photos.  At any rate, 99% of the time, colors are natural, exposure is accurate, and dynamic range is great.  At this level of camera, that's expected though.  What I really love about the 7D is the high ISO noise, or lack thereof.  The luxury of feeling confident while shooting at high ISO is priceless.  I've taken a good number of shots as high as ISO 3200 and have no complaints.  Of course there is a bit of noise, and the mushiness that noise reduction brings, but for an 18 MP image at ISO 3200, I have no complaints.  The ISO speeds above 3200 are OK as well, but I'll reserve those for emergency use only, they get fairly processed looking. (Updating this section a bit: Since the 7D is over 3 years old at this point its high ISO shooting is not as good as it once was relative to the competition.  I have a Canon G1 X and the Fuji X100 and they both do a bit better at ISO 1600 and higher.  Having said that I doubt anyone would complain about the 7D's high ISO results, but you should be aware that sensor technology has gotten better since the 7D was introduced.)  The relatively large APS-C sensor not only allows for low noise, but also allows me to produce nicely blurred backgrounds and great depth of field.  I couldn't achieve the same degree of that effect with the smaller 4/3 sensor in the Olympus, and I certainly couldn't do it with my point and shoot cameras unless I was in macro mode.  There is an Auto Lighting Optimizer feature that attempts to correct photos that are hard to correctly expose (e.g. big difference between shadows or highlights in a scene).  It works well for the most part, but, depending on the subject, the differences are very subtle.  There is also an image highlight tone priority option available in the menu system that limits the lowest ISO setting to 200 and helps preserve highlights a bit, but it too, is subtle. (Update 05/27/2013: Having recently decided to try shooting in RAW and editing my photos using Adobe Lightroom 4, I have noticed that it is worth the effort.  If I thought the 7D's jpegs were good, the RAW files, post-processed, are even better.  Using RAW I'm able to pull out details in the shadows and highlights, correct white balance, and remove purple fringing.  Anyone who is hesitant to shoot RAW because it sounds intimidating, just go for it.  You can always have the 7D shoot a RAW + jpeg together if you're cautious.  Thankfully, even shooting that way the 7D is a fast camera.)The HD movie mode is nicely done as well.  You set your focus, either automatically or manually, before you start recording.  You can refocus during recording but you'll definitely notice it.  You can adjust shutter speed, aperture, and ISO in manual movie mode as well.  There is a monaural microphone on the front of the camera, or you can plug in a stereo microphone.  By pressing the shutter button, you can interrupt the movie briefly to take a still photo, similar to Canon's S series super zoom cameras.The 28-135mm kit lens is nicely constructed and fairly sharp from corner to corner.  Purple fringing is not much of a problem in my photos.  The field of view is kind of narrow though.  The lens starts at 44.8mm with the 7D's 1.6x field of view crop factor taken into account.  Without a wide angle it's not an ideal all around lens, but I do feel it's worth the extra money for the kit with this lens.  You end up getting a nice, ultrasonic motor, image stabilized, 4.8x lens for a minimal cost.The only things I don't like about the camera so far are that in auto ISO you can't limit how high it goes (this has been remedied with firmware version 2.0.0 released in August 2012, see below for more details).  The other thing I'm not fond of is the fact that when you're in playback mode the most you can zoom out is a 9-image grid.  With such a large high-resolution screen I would appreciate an index grid playback mode that showed more photos.  Lastly, I find the process for setting the custom white balance a bit long winded.  You have to take a photo of a white reference object then go into the menus to choose that photo as the reference photo.  On other cameras, even Canon's point and shoots, the process is much faster, and it doesn't save the reference photo to your memory card.  It's not the worst system, and I have become very quick at it, but it could be better.All in all... a phenomenal semi-pro SLR.  The Canon 7D covers all the bases.12/17/2009 Update: I found a nice case for the 7D which fits the camera with kit lens quite well.  It doesn't fit much more than that, but it's a good case if you don't carry too many accessories with you.  It's the Lowepro Topload Zoom case.Lowepro Topload Zoom 1 Camera Bag (Black)12/19/2009 Update:  You can change the depth of field preview button to switch to another autofocus mode when you hold it down, instead of doing a depth of field preview.  I find this very useful since I hardly ever use depth of field preview.  Now if I find that the autofocus is consistently not picking the right subject for a shot, I simply hold down the depth of field preview button to have it temporarily switch from auto select mode to spot focus mode.  Very convenient.01/04/2010 Update:  Just got back from a trip to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.  The 7D was a joy to use.  I took about 160 photographs.  Of those only 4 or 5 are out of focus due to camera error.  The low light performance continues to impress me.  I took many photos at ISO 1600 through 3200 and all of the photos are completely usable.  In the large ""Sea Life"" and ""African Mammals"" rooms I was able to take sharp pictures of these very dim rooms while shooting handheld at ISO 3200 and no flash (see pictures).  Anyone who has visited these exhibits knows how challenging they can be to shoot.10/20/2010 Update:  I am still loving this camera.  No problems to report.  In fact, I was a little miffed when Canon introduced the 60D because it seemed like I could have saved some money by buying that, however, one of the students in my digital photography class bought one, and while it is a nice camera, the build quality and design are nowhere near the standards on the 7D.  Still happy with my purchase.04/05/2011 Update:  Still no problems to report with the camera.  I took it out after a recent snow storm when it was still flurrying and it survived just fine.01/02/2012 Update: Still no problems to report with the 7D.  I continue to recommend it.06/13/2012 Update: The camera still works wonderfully.  I've purchased the Canon 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM lens to replace the kit lens as I was looking for something sharper and a bit wider, and the 24-105 does indeed deliver.  Build quality and sharpness are much higher than the kit lens. Canon EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM Lens for Canon EOS SLR Cameras07/05/2012 Update: I picked up Canon's new pancake 40mm f/2.8 lens and it makes a great addition to the 24-105 lens.  It's small, sharp, and quick to focus.  It really does make a huge difference in the 7D's weigh and size and makes carrying the camera on a long hike easy.Canon EF 40mm f/2.8 STM Lens08/15/2012 Update: I just installed Canon's firmware update version 2.0.0.  The update improves many things; maximum RAW burst of 25 images, in camera RAW editing, JPEG resizing, image rating, maximum auto ISO setting, audio level adjustment in movies, GPS compatibility, file name customization, faster scrolling of zoomed images, and quick control screen during playback.  The firmware was easy to install and download and took only a few minutes.08/20/2012 Update: I just picked up Canon's 50mm f/1.4 lens for low light shooting, and it is indeed a great low light friend.  The angle of view is a bit tight, but it produces sharp photos with shallow depth of field and nicely blurred backgrounds, especially at f/2.0 and wider.  Also, the camera is still working like new and I have no mechanical problems to report.  However, a bit of the rubberized coating is coming off of the mode dial.  It's very subtle though, and completely cosmetic.Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 USM Standard & Medium Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR Cameras10/25/2012 Update: I got Canon's 60mm EF-S macro lens and it's a great macro lens.

It makes a great all around / museum lens.  It's very sharp and quick to focus.Canon EF 28mm f/2.8 IS USM Wide Angle Lens05/28/2013 Update: I purchased Canon's 70-300 IS USM lens and it makes a decent telephoto option at a great price.

So many superlatives have been used with the D300 that I will not repeat them here.  All the superlatives used with the D300 applies equally well to the D700.  I will add however that as good as the superlatives may have been with the D300, the D700 deserves a bit more.Let me explain.The Nikon D700 is equipped with a full frame FX sensor (36.00mm x 23.90mm).  This is the same sensor used by the Nikon D3.Nikon D3 12.1MP FX Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)The D300 on the other hand uses the APS-C sensor (23.60mm x 15.80mm).  Both the D700 and the D300 have about the same 12 megapixel rating (with the D300 actually slightly higher).The D700 having a bigger sensor than the D300 but with about the same megapixel rating means that the size/pixel density of the D700 is much lower than the D300.  The ratio is 1.4MP/cm2 vs 3.3MP/cm2 for the D700 and the D300 respectively.  A lower ratio means lower noise and this ratio favors the D700.  For the D700, this translates to lower noise in capturing the same image than when using using the D300.The D700 lower noise level in turn translates to the D700 being able to operate at a higher ISO level than the D300.  The D700 can operate as high as ISO 25,600 while the D300 can go up to ISO 6,400.  It is of course quite rare to shoot at such high ISO as it will always be better to shot at a lower ISO rating.  But if both the D700 and D300 were shooting at the same ISO, the D700 will have lower noise levels.  Simply put, the higher ISO capability of the D700 versus the D300 indicates the higher level of performance of the D700's sensor vs the D300.My actual use validates this theoretical advantage.  I noticed that while the noise level of the D300 is very good at ISO 1600 and even 3200, the D700 consistently showed lower noise level than the D300 shooting at the same ISO setting and light condition.  This is most noticeable when shooting at night with many bright lights in the periphery of the main subject.In terms of color rendition, I have not noticed any significant differences between the D300 and the D700 in the limited time that I have been using the D700.  It may be due to the fact that I have conducted my test at dusk and at night.When using the D700, the full frame sensor means that one will not need to convert the focal length of the lens by a factor of 1.5x.  So a 50mm lens will be a 50mm lens for the D700 rather than its 75mm equivalent when used with the D300.While this may appear to be a disadvantage on the telephoto side, its gain on the wide angle side is considerable and can only be described as an eye opener.  The D700 advantage in wide angle application does not just come from its wider perspective.  Rather, it is how the D700 maximizes and makes full use of such excellent lens as the Nikon 14-24mm f/2.8 that makes buying the D700 such an eye opener.The resulting images taken with the Nikon D700 and the Nikon 14-24mm are clearer, sharper and crisper compared to the D300 even when the focal length in the D700 is zoomed out to its equivalent in the the D300 (21mm in D700 and 14mm in D300).  Vignetting is not noticeably worse even when the D700 is used with the 14-24mm glass fully open at its widest focal length (14mm, f/2.8).  This is surprising considering that the D700 is now using the full lens instead of just its sweet spot in the center (which would have been to the advantage of the D300 due to its APS-C sensor).It is not just the wide angle lens that benefited from the D700.  Even the slight vignetting I noticed with my 85mm f/1.4 shot with the D300 at f/2.8 is not considerably worse in the D700.  I am very surprised at this rather unexpected results as I had expected the opposite.  At any rate, vignetting is easily corrected in post-processing.Still, I should add that for corner to corner sharpness (such as in landscape photography), the D700 with its full-frame sensors will be more demanding on the lens than the D300 with its smaller APS-C sensor.As to the physical differences between the D700 and the D300, while these two models are roughly equal in size, the D700 is slightly heavier than the D300.  This is not an issue for me at all.What tilts the balance in favor of the D700 is its view finder which is significantly brighter and better than the D300.  This difference is very noticeable when switching from the D700 to the D300 and vice versa.This much improved viewfinder however is a mixed blessing.  One disadvantage that the D700 has over the D300 is that the D700 viewfinder captures only 95% of the image while the D300 viewfinder captures 100% of the image shot.  So the actual image captured is slightly bigger than what appears in the D700 viewfinder.  I understand that this resulted from fitting the bigger sensor from the D3 into the body size of a D300.  Given the better image quality of the D700 viewfinder and the better quality of its pictures, I am willing to work with this disadvantage and simply compensate for it during actual use.  But I hope that Nikon corrects this though in its next iteration of the D700.The D700 has an advantage over the D3 as it has an integrated flash which the D3 does not have.  The integrated flash is extremely useful when used with the other components of Nikon's Creative Lightning System.The Nikon MB-D10 Battery PackNikon MB-D10 Multi Power Battery Pack for Nikon D300 & D700 Digital SLR Camerasfrom the D300 fits the D700 perfectly well.  This is very convenient as I can opt for a smaller and lighter package when I do not need the MB-D10 for high-speed shooting.  This is one advantage that the D700 has over the D3 where the battery pack is integrated with the camera.  But a D700 with an MB-D10 is bigger and heavier than a D3.  And even when the D700 is equipped with an MB-D10, the D3 is still faster.  This makes the D3 a better unit for sports photography.Since I shoot mostly portrait, special events and landscape and seldom shoot sports, the D700 is perfect for my needs and I can do without the D3.  The D700 lower price tag means that I can get the D700 with at least one of Nikon's professional lens.Nikon 14-24mm f/2.8G ED AF-S Nikkor Wide Angle Zoom LensNikon 16-35mm f/4G ED VR II AF-S IF SWM Wide Angle Zoom Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR CamerasNikon 24-70mm f/2.8G ED AF-S Nikkor Wide Angle Zoom LensNikon AF-S NIKKOR 70-200mm f/2.8G ED VR II LensNikon 85mm f/1.4G AF-S Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLRNikon 50mm f/1.8G AF-S NIKKOR Lens for Nikon Digital SLR CamerasNikon 35mm f/1.4G AF-S FX SWM Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR CamerasNikon 24mm f/1.4G ED AF-S RF SWM Prime Wide-Angle Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR CamerasIdeally, the D700 should not be used with the DX lenses.  This said, it is possible to use the DX lenses with the D700.  The D700 makes the switch to DX lens automatically without need to fiddle with any control.  Because the DX lens covers only a section of the D700 sensor, the maximum resolution of using a DX lens on the D700 is only 5.1 megapixel.  This smaller coverage is automatically delineated by a box in the D700 viewfinder.  In addition to the lower resolution, the extreme two ends of a zoom lens is not usable.  Within these limitations, the D700 can use DX lens and produces very good pictures albeit on a smaller resolution / file size.The D700/FX (1.0x factor) and the D300/DX (1.5x factor) effectively doubles my lens option.  For those planning to own both the D300 and the D700, it would be wise to choose a glass that would be usable with both bodies.In closing, I consider the D700 a good complement to my D300.  Except for my Nikon 18-200mm DX lens (which I bought for my Nikon D200), all my glasses and accessories for the D300 can be used with the D700 at its full resolution.  I will use the D700 in those times when I need the best results shooting wide angle and/or at high ISO speed.  In those times when I need the extra reach, the D300's 1.5x crop factor makes the best use of my telephoto lenses.Edit: November 22, 2008I continue to use both the Nikon D300 and the Nikon D700 and often bring both together whenever I go out to shoot.  In those times when I just bring one camera body, I choose the D300 whenever range and higher pixel density is a major concern (bec. of the 1.5x crop factor effect on the field of view due to the smaller APS-C sensor but with resolution still at 12megapixel).  The D300 is an excellent camera and its 1.5x factor is very handy when I need to reach out with a 70-200mm f/2.8 zoom or with my 180mm f/2.8 prime without need of using a teleconverter.  For almost every other instance, including portrait, landscape and low light photography however, I find myself reaching out for the D700.After over 3 and a half months of use, I can safely say that the color depth of the D700 is significantly much better than the D300. The range of colors, the color details, the varying shade of colors, and the dynamic range  that the D700 is capable of capturing is considerably better and richer than what the D300 is capable of.  This advantage is best appreciated when taking portrait and landscape photos.  The difference in dynamic range is specially noticeable when shooting at higher ISO settings as noise imposes considerable limits on the dynamic range possible.  The D700 is clearly better than the D300 on dynamic range at high ISO settings.One other difference I should mention between the D300 and the D700 is the difference that the sensor size has on effective depth of field.  The bigger the sensor, the shallower the depth of field while the smaller the sensor, the greater the depth of field.  Point and shoot cameras with minuscule-sized sensor often have the greatest depth of field.The D700, having a bigger full-frame sensor, has a shallower depth of field than the D300 (which has the smaller APS-C sensor) at the same aperture setting given the same equivalent lens focal length.  The difference in the effective depth of field is about one stop.  At the same equivalent focal length, the equivalent depth of field of a D700 at f/2.0 would be a D300 at f/1.4.The shallower depth of field of the D700 would be an advantage to a user who would like to isolate a subject and blur the background.  The deeper depth of field of the D300 would be an advantage to a user who would like to keep several subjects at difference distances in focus.  I use the D700 where I need to isolate a subject, blur the background, and get the best bokeh.  This effect is most noticeable when shooting at wide open apertures from f/1.4 to f/2.8.  This, plus the color advantage of the D700, makes the D700 my preferred body for shooting portraits.Finally, one difference I notice between the D700 and the D300 is that the D700 has a better damped shutter release button.  I find that it is easier to release the shutter in the D700 than in the D300.  This makes a big difference when shooting at low shutter speeds.Update: 02-10-2012With the D800 finally available, I thought I'd share my analysis on the D700 vs the D800Factors that works 2 ways:  Higher resolution= greater details= but requires higher memory card capacity= but requires higher storage capacity= but requires more RAM and faster CPU and better graphics cardImprovements in the D800 over the D700 other than sensor resolution1.  100% Viewfinder2.  Better AF3.  Better metering4.  Better WB5.  HD Video6.  Improved dynamic range7.  Improved color8.  Superior live view functions9.  Bigger 3.2"" LCD screen9.  Improved ergonomics and now with more buttons10. Lighter in weight by 95 grams11. Higher capacity battery12. Extra SDHC slot and support13. USB 3.0Disadvantage of D800 vs D700 other than sensor resolution1. 5fps vs 8fps on FX using battery pack2. Higher resolution requires slightly higher shutter speed to shoot handheld to achieve the same corner/border acuity.3. Higher resolution requires the best lenses to get good results, specially at side & corners4. Higher resolution means lens diffraction occurs earlier at f/9 instead of f/13 with D700 (if more DOF needed)5. Optional MB-D12 battery pack for D800 is priced almost double the optional MB-D10 battery pack for D700The D800 is not a true D700-replacement in that it does not use the D4 sensor.  Except for a slower frame-rate however, the D800 outperforms the D700 in all respects.  I have placed an order for a D4 and also added an order for a D800E.  I will however still be keeping my D700.","08 1, 2008",A34A3J7ARTHEW7,"LGO ""LG10""",88.0,A review of the Nikon D700 by a Nikon D300 owner,1101.0,649.0,1217548800.0,2363.0,28.1309113735,13.7775535524,14.3533578211,0.10521819271,0.0,0.872975261664

I'm a PC power user and I also work in the IT field.  I've never hitched my wagon to one horse.  I use Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.  I normally purchase Windows PCs but in all honesty, I wasn't very impressed with the Windows 8 preview and until I see how this radically new Windows version pans out, I'm afraid to invest in a new Windows machine.  I've already gotten burned (badly) when I was  an early adopter to both Windows ME and Vista.  I'm not eager to go through the same headaches yet again after dishing out four figures for a new PC.  Besides, I needed to replace an aging iMac and I like to have at least one up-to-date Mac in the house, so instead of another Mac desktop, I chose a Macbook as my new laptop.  Two birds, one stone.  And if I want, I can run Win 7 virtually on my new Mac.It's not perfect and it's not the world's most fantastic and ridiculously powerful laptop as some would have you believe but it's a pretty decent laptop in its own right. It's powerful enough to handle pretty much anything you can throw at it, be it video encoding, photo editing, gaming, whatever.  The screen is absolutely gorgeous, despite all the stories you've heard about everything from image retention to fuzzy graphics. Don't get me wrong, the machine is not without it's issues (more on that later) but it's still a great machine and I have absolutely no buyer's remorse.Pros:I put the word ""MY"" before my pros and cons because these are features important to me.  Other features such as USB 3, HDMI, and Thunderbolt aren't really pros to me because on a laptop costing this much, it had BETTER have at least USB 3 and an HDMI out port...MY Pros:Guts - The CPU, SSD and GeForce combo in the base model is very powerful and more than sufficient for most of my computing needs.  Quad-core Ivy bridge CPU mated with fast SSD drive means ultra-fast boot times.  I boot in 15 seconds or less.  It also means faster responsiveness from some apps. Everything flows so smoothly and I rarely see the spinning beach ball.  I don't normally do a ton of multitasking.  I prefer to open windows as I need them instead of having a million windows open at once all over the place in a cluttered and confusing array.  Therefore, the 8GB of standard RAM is more than sufficient for me. I mostly dabble on the programming side, so I don't need this for any beefy work-related projects.  I mainly use it for video editing, photo editing, household management and other personal tasks.  I occasionally play a game or two as well.Size - Size is very portable.  Although it's a little heavy (more on that below), the thin size still makes it easily transportable.Cooling - The design of the laptop makes it run cooler than traditional Macbooks.  This is something you can see/feel for yourself.  Go to the nearest brick and mortar store with both the retina and non-retina 2012 Macbooks on display and feel them.  The non-retinas feel much warmer.  This thing runs cool even when encoding video.  I have yet to hear my fan kick in during an intensive task.Power Supply - I know a lot of former Macbook owners are angry with the new power adapter but it's my first Macbook, so I'm speaking from that perspective.  It magnetically attaches and detaches to the Mac.  Now, I've seen the old Apple ads where laptops got accidentally pulled off of tables etc due to tripping over cords.  I've tripped and snagged my fair share of PC cords and most popped right out of the port instead of ripping the laptop off the table, so this isn't so much a necessary safety measure as it is a cool feature.  The Magsafe adapter itself is huge.  I wish it were a little smaller but compared to the typical power brick of as PC, I still love it.  It resembles an over-sized iPad power adapter.Body - I won't lie.  The aluminum body is a thing of beauty.  I like looking at it almost as much as I like using it.  I will admit, the sleek aluminum Macs are a welcome relief to the usual drab slate grey metallic bodies of the business laptops I work with daily at work and the cheap-looking plastic covered consumer grade laptops around my home.Display - I saved the screen for last because you've already heard enough about it. It has to be seen in person to be truly appreciated. I realize it's scaled-down to a lower resolution (depending if you select the default resolution setting best for retina"") but whatever Apple is doing makes the image razor sharp, which I'm sure aging eyes like mine likely appreciates a lot more than most younger eyes.Now for...My Cons:Completely and totally non-upgradeable.  I see what Apple is doing, fusing the iPad and Mac to eventually become one, but it doesn't mean I like it.  I had to really think long and hard about getting a rMBP.  The reasons that led to me deciding on it are explained below.  Just realize, whatever you buy initially is what you will be stuck with for the life of the computer.  I use multiple computers and this is primarily for personal home use, but if you are buying one for commercial or really intensive power usage, think long and hard about what you need before ordering (If you even decide a rMBP is even still right for you).Lack of Ethernet port.  Sure... WiFi suffices for most needs, but what about bandwidth intense needs, like content-heavy VPN or Citrix sessions? WiFi is not a catch-all solution for everything.  Judging by the body dimensions, I'm hard-pressed to figure out why they omitted it.  It begins to diminish the portability factor, which I'm assuming was the primary reason they omitted so many  standard ports in the first place, if I have to walk around with adapters for everything (firewire, ethernet, etc).Battery is sealed, glued, and otherwise stuck in there forever.  Wish it were replaceable or at least capable of being disconnected for maintenance.  I guess the fact that you can't do any maintenance makes that a moot issue anyhow... But at least Ibattery life seems on par with my other laptops. I don't throw battery times out there because everyone uses their laptop differently.  My usage may yield only 3 hrs whereas yours might give you twice that.  I average at least 3-4 hrs of moderate usage on battery.  If I use it lightly (email, web browsing and nothing more power-hungry than office programs), I can get a couple hours per day for about three or four days before needing to recharge.Weight - As thinner and smaller as the rMBP is when compared to the non-retina, once you pick it up, that advantage quickly dissipates. Imagine dating a super-model with a super-model body and when you go to lift her in your arms, you discover she somehow manages to weigh 200 lbs under seemingly skin and bones.  It's sleek, lean, mean and heavy.  It's not super heavy like some mobile workstations, but as my super-model analogy shows, the form factor is slightly deceiving.  Don't expect it to be light as, well... AirNo K-slot.  What good is a transportable friendly laptop if they give you no way to lock it down temporarily while on the go?  When I was away, I'd loop my lock cable around an immovable object like a piece of furniture or something that would require much more work than a casual thief would be willing to invest.  If they wanted my laptop, they'd have to cut the cable with bolt cutters or disassemble whatever I had the laptop attached to.  Now they can freely walk in and either grab the laptop or locked case I store it in because Apple has given us no other way to secure it.Display - Yes, the infamous retina display makes both the pro and con list.  The reason it makes the con list is because I have already returned one rMBP due to a yellowish hued screen.  The second screen was much better.  Although I haven't experienced any image-retention issues, I'm still a little paranoid because I have an LG panel.  Everyone says ""try to get a Samsung panel"" but you'll be hard-pressed to find a rMBP without an LG panel. And I'm not obsessive nor petty enough to go through five or so Macbooks trying to get a Samsung panel.  If I experience any IR issues down the road, I'll handle it.  Otherwise, life goes on.  As for other issues, yes, some web sites, apps, and other content do occasionally appear fuzzy or blocky. It's not anywhere near as bad as some are making it out to be and it really a non-issue for me, especially considering that the overwhelming majority of items that render badly are usually those spammy ads alongside the web page.Intangibles - like most first gen Apple products, there are the bugs.  The display issues are widely known but some lesser known issues exist as well, like WiFi and Bluetooth.  Whenever I tried to boot with both enabled, my WiFi would not connect.  So, I disabled Bluetooth.  I've had a few other weird anomalies but nothing that has tempted me to pack everything up and make a beeline for the Apple store.  One thing I'd like to mention is the feud between Apple and Adobe appears to have mad its way to the laptops as well.  There is no Flash installed out the box.  So, unless you want to see a lot of error messages, I suggest either going straight to Adobe for Flash or downloading Chrome which has a much safer and more stable sandbox Flash.So, why did I ultimately decide on the rMBP?  Well, Apple almost forces your hand to buy the rMBP.  Here's why1)  The standard resolution of the non-retina Macbook Pro is too low to justify the price.  1,440 X 900 is so... 2008.  Sadly, Apple's own retina Macbook does a wonderful job of showing just how choppy and ugly that resolution is.  Even after paying a $100 premium to upgrade to the Apple high-res screen option (matte or glossy), the 1680 X 1050 resolution still pales compared to the 1920 X 1080 resolution of most comparable Windows laptops.  Even though the ""optimal for retina"" display is scaled lower, the screen still looks incredibly sharp when next to a non-retina Macbook, which looks grainy by comparison.2) The size of the new retina Macbook makes it almost more comparable to a Macbook Air than a traditional Macbook but for those thinking ""I'll just get the Air"", you could, but it would be less capable machine.  I was ready to return my rMBP and exchange it for an Air but by the time I configured an Air I was happy with, it was the same price as the baseline rMBP. Although it had the same amount of RAM and a 512GB SSD, I lost the screen, extra ports, extra two inches of screen size, discrete graphics and quad-core CPU.  Although the air is lighter and more portable, I prefer the power of the rMBP over the extra 256GB of SSD and slightly better portability of the maxed-out Air.  If I weren't buying this as a desktop replacement for an iMac, I might have gone with the Air.So there you have it.  Should you buy it?  Well, if you're in the market for a desktop replacement or high-end Macbook and can live with the tradeoffs (non-upgradable, limited storage, first-gen issues), then go for it.  You can't go wrong.  If you already have a capable Mac with discreet graphics that can handle your power needs and are considering buying this as a mobile companion PC, then go for the Air.  You really can't justify the price of this thing if you aren't a power user or already have a capable Mac.  If you have a 2011 Macbook, I strongly advise just upgrading to Mountain Lion and awaiting the second generation rMBP.  I think you'll ultimately be very happy you did.  Just take this one fact away:  Apple designed these things to be disposable, like tablets.","09 20, 2012",A2WB7LZ595CR50,J.

However, there are some major issues with this feature:1. It makes a mess of your hard drive!  Instead of cleanly saving all the background images, poster thumbnails and meta data into the "".wd tv"" folder it normally creates, the WD TV Live just dumps all these files into the same folder as your video files.  On top of that, it also creates a folder for each movie's background images.  So, if you have 300 movies in a folder, it will create 300 folders for their backdrop images.  Really?  Does WD have a bunch of junior developers working for them?  I seriously hope WD picks a much less obtrusive way to save movie sheet information in their next update.  Otherwise, buy the Popcorn Hour A-300.  Sure, it costs 3x as much, but the software is well thought out and programmed by senior developers.2.  You have to enable WRITE access to your network drives for the Media Library to work.  What's new about the 3rd gen is that it also has the ability to DELETE files!  What?  Yes, that's correct.  So, if you have kids in the house, it's very easy for them to delete entire folders of videos from the network.  And as we all SHOULD know, if you execute a Windows delete file command to a network drive, that file is not moved into the RECYCLE BIN, it is DELETED FROM YOUR HARD DRIVE!  WD, if you are going to force us to enable WRITE access to network drives, then please give us the ability to lock out the DELETE function of this device!  Do your engineers not have children in their households?  BEWARE that if you have kids in your house, buying this device entails a high risk of your kids deleting your files.  You can't blame the kids, they're kids, but we can blame WD for this huge oversight.3.  A much better solution to problem #2 would be to add 8gb-16gb of internal memory in the gen 4 of this device and write all the files necessary for the Media Library feature internally.  For us gen 3 owners, give us the option to write these files to a USB flash drive.  It's easy to buy a 8gb-16gb flash drive these days and they are inexpensive.4.  The ""themoviedb.org"" search alogrithm is about as smart as the junior developers who probably created it.  Say you have a movie file called, ""Alexender (2004)"" and the first result in a search on themoviedb.org returns ""Alexander (2004),"" you would think that it would be able to match the movie right?  Right???5.  It doesn't know to collapse multi-part files into a single movie sheet item.  What if you have a video file in multiple parts?  Well, this Media Library lists each of them separately.6.  The Media Library needs a dedicated interface for TV Series.  Have WD engineers never heard of this thing called Netflix?  Please, try it out sometime guys.FACEBOOK INTEGRATIONDoes WD have a QA department or do they just use their customers to QA their products?  I was pretty excited at the ability to use images from my photo albums on Facebook as my screen saver.  However, the images look pixelated or incomplete.  Pixelated, as in, it appears that the image is downloaded in multiple passes, with each successive pass becoming more and more sharp...unfortunately, it never manages to get past the first pass.  Incomplete, as in, only a part of the image appears and it appears ""truncated"" with the rest of the image being a solid gray color.  WD, if you don't know how to set up a QA dept, there are plenty of companies that you can source out QA to.ANDROID REMOTE CONTROL APPLICATIONLooks like it was term project made by first year computer science students.  Actually, I take that back.  I'm sorry if I offended any first year computer science students!  I've seen work by computer science students that are designed and programmed 10x better than this joke of an Android app.  Here's a clue that your marketing department should have made your project managers aware of:  iPhone users tend to stick with Apple products!  Besides that, Android has 53% market share compared to 24% IOS.  Therefore, shift more money hiring senior Android developers to make your Android remote control app.  And then, with whatever money is left, offshore the IOS remote control app.  This feature was one of the reasons why I upgraded to the 3rd gen device.  Read the reviews your users have left you in the Android Market.BOTTOM LINEWD, if it costs you $20, $30, $50 more to make a better product, DO IT!  And charge me for it!  The time that I've spent trying to find fixes (which none seem to exist on your forum) for these issues have costed me way more than $50 in opportunity cost.*UPDATED* NOTES AFTER LONGER OWNERSHIP PERIODI have 6 USB drives attached to a true HTPC in the family room. It runs Win 7 Ult x64.I have the HTPC on 24/7 and this stupid box always takes a good 5-8mins to power up from SLEEP. It takes FOREVER to find the Windows Network Shares and takes A LONG TIME to compile (or whatever) the metadata for the Movie Library feature.Not to mention it writes all these garbage metadata files and folders to your hard drive.At least every other day, it drops and can no longer find the Windows Network Shares. My work around is to unplug the WD TV, then reboot my HTPC, then plug the WD TV back in. This is like a 12min process.If you plan to only use 1 local USB drive attached directly to the machine, it should be fine.But, in summary, this is $80 and has a lot more features than the previous gen, but it also has MANY MORE ANNOYANCES and is definitely LESS STABLE at keeping the connection with your Windows Network Shares. I never had an issue w/the previous gen.The UI animations are fast, but reading data is SLOW, ie, it takes about 6 secs to read, then start to fade in a movie poster in the background. Very often, my GF has already passed the movie poster displayed in the background by 2-3 titles, that's how much lag there is.WD should really just store all the metadata locally on thumb drive.If you buy it, be mindful of the return period (2wks) and test it out to the max. $80 pays for 1/3 of a true HTPC which you can run XBMC (which blows this thing away).","01 14, 2012",AHSVU6B7EADS1,NeoEngineer,57.0,Issues not covered in other reviews,17.0,503.0,1326499200.0,1165.0,38.6003324898,18.603218413,19.9971140768,0.0759137284489,0.0,0.872842248607

A point and shoot guy for over 40 years, half of which I never knew which side of the camera to look through.As I am being dragged into the 21st century I decided it was time to invest in a decent camera. Plus I was at the point where if I researched one more camera my brains were going to pour out of my ears.I've had my eye on the FZ200 since it's pre-release. Yet I kept putting the purchase off and instead bought the under-rated Fujifilm X-S1 which is an excellent camera however the feature set, Image Stabilization and dazzling low light performance of the FZ200 beats the Fuji hands down - as it does with any other Bridge camera in this price range.I had also considered the following:1) An entry level DSLR the Nikon D3100 or the Canon T3i 22) Out of the Bridge cameras I had narrowed it down to  a few but the Panasonic FZ200 was always my first choice. Not only is it insanely popular it won Cnet's coveted Editors Choice award. The review by senior editor Josh Goldman is well worth watching if you're considering this camera or even if you already own it, the review has value.I have great admiration for Panasonic products, aside from our televisions I have a Panny Professional AG - HMC40 Video camera. I mention this because the Tech support from Panasonic has been so stellar. For me, this is a key issue, if there's a problem these folks will take all the time needed to help you out - a rarity these days.During a trouble shooting session with the video cam (which is a different department) I made it a point to talk with the Panny Tech about the FZ200 luck was in my favor as the Tech in the Pro department not only had a soft spot for the FZ200 he was happy to answer any questions I had. At one point during our conversation he told me -  ""Look, you won't learn this camera in a few days or even weeks - period. that's just not going to happen. Use the manual as a reference and most of all, start shooting in IA mode and see how you do""It was great advice.I have spent hours taking pictures of our Bulldogs romping outside- over 200 photographs. The photos with exception of a just a few are spectacular. Crystal clear, wonderfully rich and sparkling with vibrant true to life colors - I was dazzled.Normally I would be in Corels Paintshop Pro or Adobe Lightroom for hours just trying to reduce the noise and blur but these images were pristine. Harley our oldest bulldog was born to play soccer. That said, because the recovery time between shots and focusing is so lightening fast the ""action"" shots of him playing, running, moving his gargantuan orange ball around were perfect, so perfect even caught in mid air. The images are blur free - it was hard to believe I had taken them.This camera is blazing fast.Low light conditions is where the FZ200 really shines. Pictures in dim lighting come out rich and clear. I've never had a camera perform so well in near dark conditions and that's without using the flash. The Feature set is sensational. The camera has so many intriguing built in filters and modes such as Miniaturize, old movie. Sepia and other creative modes it's a bit overwhelming. On most other cameras I tend to think most of these are gimmicky as there's nothing you can't do in Photoshop if you're so inclined. However, the feature set is so rich and really does provide options you'll want to actually use.  The camera is free of what is the equivalent of novelty bloatware.As I was really comfortabe with the Manual Zoom on my Fuji X-S1 I wasn't sure how I would like the auto Zoom but it's terrific. Smooth as silk, accurtae and completely silent. The view finder is excellent as well and surprisingly I found myself preferring this over the LCD screen.  As for the LCD The articulation is great. Plus there's very little wash out in direct sunlight so it's always easy to read - it's nice and bright.Some First Impressions:* Built like a Tank. Although it's plastic whereas the before mentioned Fuji is an all metal body with a rubberized coating - it's still a solid machine. Nice weight and fits in the hand beautifully.* The lens is one beautiful piece of glass. The auto zoom is surprisingly accurate.* Lot's of ports. Including one for an external Mic, and an HDMI cable.* Full HD video at 1080 dpi plus built in stereo mic/speakers.* Intuitive menu for easy set up - but still LOT'S to learn, especially for a novice as myself.* Pop up flash which according to Panasonic is more than adequate up to a range of 6-10 feet indoors and out. If you're further away say, sitting up in bleachers, you'll need an external flash.* Speaking of external flashes the camera has a Hot ShoeThe entire package arrives beautifully presented. The glossy black box includes the camera of course, The battery (which takes a first 4 hour charge) a charger and power cord, a quality neck and shoulder strap, Spring loaded lens cap which fits good and tight, USB transfer cable, Manual which is surprisingly easy to understand and follow, a CD ROM with a PDF version of the both an extended manual and Silky-Pics editing software (my copy wouldn't install on any computer) registration card and some additional paper work mostly safety and care related.As for the Image Stabilization it's nothing short of a technological marvel.At the heart of Panny's patented system is a ""floating"" lens which responds immediately to any movement of the camera or hand shake. It's response time is lightening fast and does a flawless job eliminatating blur. Even at full zoom without a tripod the images are wonderful. The FZ200 is as impressive looking as the photo's it's taking are beautiful.In hind sight a DSLR would have driven me crazy lugging around all those lenses that cost more than the camera itself the FZ200 is just a superb alternative.** Back to low light performance for one moment.A blinking message on the LCD will warn you if you need to use the flash. I was totally un-aware of this feature. We had some friends over the other evening and everyone was out in the sun room which was only lit by a cluster of candles.I played around with the setting modes and while leaving the camera on IA I chose ""steady hand held nigh shot"" and used the flash with red eye reduction. The images knocked me out. I did brighten some a little in Paint Shop but this was a matter of personal taste. The flash provides superb fill light and you don't get that stark, harsh light I've experienced with other past and present cameras.**** IMPORTANT TIP*******If you're considering this camera or already own it. I urge you to log onto youtube and search out many of the excellent reviews and tutorials. I highly reccomend a gentleman out of the U.K named Graham Houghton. Graham has an entire series of videos dedicated to the FZ200. It's a superb soup nuts insight into each feature with lessons ranging from the basics to using and learning full manual settings.He doesn't work for Panasonic - he just adores this camera! It's in every way a labor of love and a huge beneft for FZ200 owners. It's virtually a free in depth course in photography put in laymen's terms and frankly was yet one more compelling reason I purchased the camera. He has educational videos on virtually everything this camera can do and puts it in easy to understand steps.This camera continues to blow me away, the build quality, the intuitive menus and most of all the incredibly vivid photographs. Folks far more advanced than I have written reviews that explain the aspects of both photography and the FZ200 far better than I am able to do. However I can offer this to you. The FZ200 is making me a better photographer and I've just begun to scratch the surface - if it can do this for me, without question it can do the same for you.Highest Recommendation!","12 15, 2013",A11FX8HL2ANK6T,Peter Suslock,60.0,A  Marvel - Best Bridge Camera At ANY Price.,17.0,662.0,1387065600.0,1456.0,50.1479682845,24.7851950206,25.3627732639,0.0593688523155,0.0,0.873113969346

I actually found out that it will not only run split screens plus 5 apps like I mentioned but up to 11.The screen resolution is NOT an issue at all. Only with the poorest of feeds will the display show up as fuzzy. The speaker stereo separation is fantastic. I didn't really notice until I played an audio book and heard how noticeable the separation actually was. I added while docked, each of my 5 different portable speakers to the back of the dock and the tablet speakers sounded better.Cons: I noticed that when using the Chrome browser, that with too many tabs open, like over 12, the cut and paste quite working and the browser froze. This forced a total reset. I finally exchanged the tablet. Same problem again. So I gave up using the Chrome browser, and not a problem one since then. So not the tablet per say, but it and chrome just don't play nice when used so heavily. With the included tablet browser, after too many open tabs, a warning notice comes up and instructs to close a tab before opening another. That's it. Love Love Love this tablet, a lot to learn but worth the price of admission imho.I have been addicted to tablets for a couple of years now. I have stayed away from Apple products for personal reasons. So Android at this time is the best bet for me. I tried a Windows tablet last year and they were not ready for my needs at that time. The ones that might, cost over $1200 or more. I spend at least 6 hours a day on a tablet. I have owned 8 Android Tablets and one Windows tablet. I still have 4 Androids.I started with a $149 K-Mart tablet and went all the way to the $600 Asus Infinity TF700T.Asus TF700T, I know the Asus TF700 is a great tablet. I bought the only one on Amazon that was defective.No choice but to return. I just have bad luck sometimes. But it turned out OK in the end. I was able to wait for this one.I have a Galaxy Note i717 5.3"" cell phone and I love it, they call it the ""phablet ""but really it is too small for a tablet and more a supersized phone. But I love the display and the S Pen. So after watching MobileTechReviews, You Tube, of Lisa showing all the features of this tablet and her doing a smack down, with this tablet and the Asus TF700 Infinity, I made the decision to buy this one.I am very happy I did.***Full Samsung video review, live links are not permitted in reviews. So to see them, click on add comments below.The first one shows the videos.Pros: 1) It shares speed honors for all Android tablet with the Asus TF700 they are too close to call. Each winning battles back and forth for sheer power and speed.2)It has split screen functions, meaning you can do two things side my side at the same time. Like read your email and do a web search on two separate screens yet on the same display screen. No other tablet can do that.3)It has a very strong WiFi modem, it pulls in signal my other tablets don't.Nice Nice Nice.4)It is one of the few tablets that pulls Wifi from both the 2.4 and the 5 bands. Exceptional.5) The touch screen is extremely sensitive and it takes only the slightest of touch to registeryour input. I think because of the S Pen's needs for sensitive touch of over 1,000 ranges. I mean this touchscreen is the best I have ever used or touched.It tracks you finger movement extremely tightly.No noticeably lag, it is like the item you are moving is stuck to your finger. Most if not all Android tablets have some lag. So good job Samsung on that.6) It has picture in picture video. You can run a movie on any screen and your can move the movie box around any where on your display surface. You can re-size it if it gets in the way. The display has settings like a TV or monitor, you adjust the color and tone.7) It has a feature called Smart Stay, which is basicly a little eye that watches your eye. If you fall asleep watching a video, it shuts off. In the morning it has your place saved in the video where it shut off at. Nice feature for me.8) It will handle up to a Micro 64GB SDXC storage card which writes up to 30mbps, really adding lots of extra storage since most tablets only support 32GB. Ipad and Nexus 7 don't support any on board.9) It has a decent front camera for video chat, and the a decent rear camera with a flash, tablets are not cameras but this one is above average.10) It has the S Pen, meaning your can write, draw and lots lots lots more.11) The software is unique to this tablet only, meaning you can do things on this tablet no other tablet can do. There are some others, older, that have some features similar but not close to this guy.12) It will convert your printing or hand writing into text. It plots and solves equations.13) It will convert your hand drawn circles and squares to proper ones, making your look good. It just has too many features to list with the S Pen.14) It comes with PhotoShop software and the only limit is your imagination.15) It has front facing speakers like all tablets should have.16) It comes in White and it is lite and attractive and with 2GBs of Ram and a 1.4 Samsung Quad Core, it is one of the fastest tablets on the market and only $499..Compare to the Excite 7.7 and it is easy to see the value.17) It will handle HDMI to a big screen and USB keyboards, mice, game controllers, external hard drives, I have have tried a 500GB external hard drive, and it should do even larger, just pickup the adapters. Not expensive at all.18) It has a real GPS. Works without WiFi. Blue Tooth and so much more...19) It has too many Pros to list, really, I only scratched the surface. Oh, it is also an IR remote control for you home TV system, even controls cable or Direct TV, it learns your favorite shows and suggests them to you. Too much, for sure...love it...Oh, and if you have other Samsung products, like a Galaxy S 3, it talks to them as well with All Share...neat...it also has a very deluxe battery monitor system that has 4 sections with lots of graphs and setting and over heat warnings to get extra months of battery life.I later watched a Samsung 10 minute and he showed multi-tasking up to 5 functions at once. Email and Polaris on the 2 split screens,then adding picture in picture video on top of those two adding the calculator and another pop up screen, over the 4 programs already opens. 5 open screens at once on and Android SupervTablet.VersusCons: 1) It gets a knock for only having a 1280x800 resolution display screen, but, really it has adjustments like a TV has and your can set picture settings. So no, it doesn't have Retina, but it does just fine without it. Since not many apps support those hi resolution displays anyway. It could not be priced at $499 if it had all it has, plus the over the top display. This one is just fine, and I am fussy. Speaking of fussy, since I do go back and forth with multiple tablets, the two things that keep this tablet from being 100% perfect for me are simple. The blacks are fine but could be deeper. The whites are fine but could be whiter. While using this tablet I don't notice this. When I switch back to another of my tablets, I am reminded of this fact.However,once I pick up this tablet, I forget all about it and just enjoy it for all it's features.2) This is not an iPad, so it takes some effort to get the most out of it, so expect a learning curve for the S Pen, but it can be used as a basic Android tablet if you want to GROW into it. If you are a person with no computer skills, it may be a bit much for you. Then again, you can just use what you understand. Emails, videos, Facebook, Web Browsing, and you can have a lot of fun playing with the pen3) Double edge sword, the good it will fully charge on a 5v source like a USB port or 5v power block, the bad is it takes up to 5 hours to charge. So best to charge at night. In contrast my Asus charges in 2 hour 15 minutes but on 5v and turned off, it will only charge 50% all night because it's wall charger is 12-15v.4) The biggest CON is it took so long to get here.....Signed Happy New Owner...Cheers","08 20, 2012",A3Q3ICZ7K0RA1V,Carol A.

So I did, and the power button is much better now. Why it wasn't like this from the start, I don't know. But back too my original 4 stars. This thing is nice, but a tad quirky. But I'm connected to my TV via Miracast now, and it's pretty cool. Such is the way of new toys sometimes. Not all the kinks have been worked out.***UPDATE*** - Reduced rating to 2 stars because the power button is VERY problematic.  Can't get it to turn the PC on 90% of the time. May have to call Asus about a repair.  It's a simple concept: if you can't turn it on, then it's useless. In fact, as I type this, I realize I have to just give it 1 star.  Shame, as this had so much promise.Back to the original review.....Asus is really measuring up to be a great laptop. I've been a fan since the motherboard days, and am really starting to like them over Toshiba, as my go-to laptop brand. I have anASUS A55VD-AH71, and am quite impressed with it, because its got a lot of punch, and is one of the few economical laptops out there that still has a physical graphics card.  This Transformer Book can't hold a match to that, but for a budget tablet/laptop, it's pretty amazing. Unfortunately, it's got a lot of hiccups too.Is it a Tablet or a Laptop?BOTH! That's the coolest thing about this little guy -- it's a full-fledged touch-screen laptop, that detaches from the keyboard to transform into a tablet! Cool to say the least.  The footprint is basically 10.25"" x 6.75"" and about .75"" thick with the keyboard attached.  To detach and use in tablet mode, just push the lock button on the keyboard and remove the screen -- voila - instant tablet.  The screen reattaches quite easily and locks into place, so I can literally pick up the whole thing by the screen if I want, and the 2 parts stay securely attached.  The build feels rock solid; it doesn't feel like it'll break apart accidentally, and the 2 parts lock together and feel like one solid unit when attached. Very nice.Welcome to Windows 8 in it's Natural HabitatLike most people, I wasn't all that fond of Windows 8 when I first tried it.  It's not that the OS is bad or anything, it's just a big departure from the Windows we used to know.  Plus, Windows 8 was designed to be touched, so unless you're using it on a touchscreen laptop, then it's just cumbersome and awkward.  I ended up tweaking Win 8 on my main Asus laptop to run more like Win 7, and I'm much happier with it that way on that particular computer (non-touchscreen.)  But on this Transformer Book, Windows 8 is kinda dreamy.  I'm really falling in love with it within this context -- on a touchscreen device, where it was made to shine.  Windows 8 was meant to be swiped and touched, not clicked to death with a mouse or touch-pad.  Frankly, Microsoft shot themselves in the foot with that one -- a touchscreen device should have been mandatory for Windows 8, and that OS should NEVER be installed on a non-touchscreen device. It's just not meant to be used that way.  My opinion of Win 8 has improved 100-fold, now that I finally see it in action, the way it was meant to be used -- all touchy-feely.Fingerprint MagnetCosmetically, this Transformer Book is very attractive; sleek, chic and modern. The downside though, is it attracts fingerprints like crazy. The high gloss lid is beautiful, so long as you never touch it. But the minute you lay fingers on it, it shows every smear and smudge, and quickly looks like crap.  The touchscreen is no better. I have a new Kindle HDX, and I don't know what Amazon did to that thing, but no matter how many times I poke and touch it, I'm hard pressed to find any fingerprints on the thing. I mean, I really have to try hard to make a single smudge or smear.  This Transformer, conversely, could pick up fingerprints from an imaginary friend. The screen on my friend's iPad always looks like that too, and I never want to touch it because of that. I turn into Howie Mandel in that moment, inspecting every smear and smudge, imagining these touchscreens to be breeding grounds for every virus and staph infection known to man.  Not a very attractive feature of this otherwise beautiful laptop. I'm constantly wiping this thing down, even after just a few minutes use; it's just that bad.The Netbook ReinventedRemember those little netbooks that were virtually useless for anything but checking email? Well, that's what this reminds me of, only this time, it's actually useful.  This is a full-fledged Windows experience here, not a glorified email device.  So in that regard, you can do anything on this Transformer Book that you can do on a regular laptop.  Well, almost. It has no disk drive, so you're limited to downloadable software only. No one's gonna load Adobe's Production Suite onto this thing. But a cloud version of Photoshop might be interesting.Cloud Based SoftwareClearly that's the direction we're all headed.  Microsoft Office has already gone there, and the OS is soon to follow.  In the not too distant future, software piracy will become near obsolete, since everything will be based in the cloud; including our own documents. But the upside to that, is it should cut down on viruses, piracy and the dreaded system wipe and re-install that we've all had to suffer through on occasion.Microsoft Office IncludedEverything except Publisher, from what I can tell.  Comes with a 1 user license product key in the box.USB Recovery Disk?This comes with a USB flash drive in the box. It's very nice and chic looking, but I can't get any of my computers to recognize or read it.  I'm assuming it's a recovery disk in case the computer ever crashes.Don't Be FooledYour standard Android or Apple tablet is very easy to use.  Nary a software update or any real knowledge required.  This Transformer Book is great, since you get the best of both worlds -- tablet and laptop. But just don't become complacent, thinking you're using a run of the mill tablet. It's not. This is a full-fledged windows PC that can be used like a tablet.  But it's still Windows in all it's glory -- and with all it's security concerns too.  Be sure to install a good anti-virus or security suite, and keep it updated.  Don't fool yourself into believing you're using an innocent little tablet.  I like having the full throttle power of a Windows machine in tablet form, I just gotta remind myself to remember that it's a full Windows experience, and not just a glorified toy, like other tabs.The Hiccup List:Nice as this laptop is, there are some serious hiccups that make it feel more like a work in progress, than a fully realized idea. Here they are:> Wonky Power Button - Sometimes, I just can't get it to power this darn thing on! Or off! I just keep pressing and pressing, and nothing. Then suddenly, it works. I don't think it's broken or anything, just really finicky with how it likes to be pressed. Not a deal breaker, just a pain in the arse.> Near System Failure on Updates - as is always the case with Windows, there's a crap load of updates required right outta the gate. Asus even has a few of their own.  Problem is, once all the updates were done, it naturally wanted to reboot -- and it almost never turned back on! I almost thought I was gonna have to call tech support, because it looked like the thing had flat out died. It got stuck on a black screen for half an hour and wouldn't reboot. So I had to repeatedly futz with that wonky power button and forced about half a dozen reboots, which was a real pain, to say the least.  After several glitchy reboots and jittery screens, it did finally sputter back to life. Not sure what the issue was, but it seems to be working fine now.> Crappy Charging Port - it's got a micro USB charging port, and a nice compact charger. Only problem is, I really have to futz with it just to insert the charging cord.  It really doesn't go in very easily at all and is a real pain to work with. Huge design flaw IMO.Bottom Line - this is a fantastic little laptop, hiccups and all. I mean, I wouldn't use this as my one and only computer. But as a portable solution, this is about as good as I imagined something like this could be. LOVE how it easily transforms from a laptop to a tablet. LOVE Windows 8 in this touchscreen environment.  And LOVE the combination of portability and power.  This is the future of tablets and laptops right here, and both Android and iOS have something to be seriously worried about.  The Goliath is back in the room, and it's called Microsoft.  And now with touchscreen laptops creeping into the market, they're in prime position to keep their grasp on the market.  As far as the hiccups, I'm sure Asus will fix them over time, but for now, it's not a totally problem free experience.  Overall, this is a solid little laptop, and minus the glitches, it works as good as my budget Toshiba Win 7 i3 laptop. This is ideal for a life on the go; be it travel, work or fun.  I'm very impressed with this little guy, and excited to see where this is all going.  Quite impressive, even with the few glitches.","11 30, 2013",AQIJ3ZEEVCIKU,Kaio,96.0,Outstanding Potential -- UPDATE - Useless Power Button,11.0,641.0,1385769600.0,1724.0,38.7560683472,19.1510050776,19.6050632696,0.0768096423515,0.0,0.872857549735

There IS a catch. You have to get decent at RAW editing to get anywhere near the results you can get out of this camera. Yeah, the dynamic B&W; mode is pretty good, and I've shot low light jpgs at shows (no flash), but to get real results from the camera, you're going to have to get your hands a little dirty. The results I can get from this in RAW are just simply amazing for a camera this small. Yes, amazing. I don't throw that word around; but the color depth and sheer detail you can get in 5 minutes worth of work will just make you all smiles.What I don't like about the camera: Not much, but there are a couple of things I could point at that might make it a bit more usable.1.) It doesn't have much of a zoom. Ok, lame complaint, because I actually do understand somewhat that the laws of physics dictate how much of a zoom range you can have on a lens of a given size, without having image quality suffer. This is silly; if you need a zoom camera, this isn't what you should be looking at.2.) No viewfinder, save an aftermarket one. Ok; this actually bothers me sometimes. In bright sunlight, or very low light, a cheesy optical viewfinder would be helpful. Yes, it would also make the camera larger too.3.) The onboard flash sucks. It's cool that you can throttle it down, but if it could tilt up to be a bounce flash, it would be really, really useful. As it is, it always seems to be either too bright, and washes everything out, or too dark. It's a good thing this camera has good ISO performance at 400, and acceptable at 800; with the f2.0 aperture, it can take pictures in VERY low light, and still look great. Oh, and the hotshoe mount will accept a full sized flash :)4.) Lack of a focus ring. Of course, without a decent viewfinder, that wouldn't be of much use, and we're moving away from what the camera is, so I understand the lack. The manual focus on the camera is quite decent, I should mention.4.) That's it. Nothing else not to like about the camera. If you need a zoom lens, or the lack of a viewfinder is a deal breaker for you, go with the larger Canon G10/G11. The DMC-LX3 works better for my needs, being a 24mm f2.0 lens, and having unbelievable RAW data to work with.What I do like about the camera1.) It's small; purpose built. You won't draw crowds using this camera. It's almost friendly. It looks quite nice too. I can stroll through the city, taking pictures of folks, and they just don't seem to mind as much as when I'm doing the same with a DSLR. So for low key urban photography, this is actually BETTER than a DSLR (what, a compact camera does something better than an DSLR?).2.) Fantastic lens. Can't say enough about it, for the price point, and camera size, it's awesome. Really wide angle, if you like landscape or urban photography, it's the perfect focal range.3.) Best low light compact camera on the market, period. Yep, I'll stand by that. It SMOKES the G10/G11 in low light; I love going to see local bands in small clubs; these venues aren't very well lit, but you can get right by the stage. This thing takes fantastic pictures in low light. I don't care what the reviews say either about ISO 400 or ISO 800; check the images out in RAW, and then say ISO 800 isn't usable. Speaking of which;4.) ISO performance. ISO 800 is a little bit grainy; but the best thing is, that it is a usable grain, not some watercolor chromatic that just ruins everything. I say ISO 800 is just fine for color photographs; it can even make gritty B&W; images look better (cleaner is NOT always better)5.) Ridiculous RAW performance; the camera is fast and responsive, even when shooting full sized JPEG and RAW. Never seems to really bog, and when it does; it still will buffer what your doing. Really amazing for a camera this size, and it makes RAW the only image format I even think about using. The amount of detail; color, edge retention, contrast; try this camera out with Adobe Lightroom, and you'll see what I mean, and you'll have a blast to boot.6.) Multiple image formats; at first, reading it on paper, I thought it was just a gimmic; 4:3,3:2, & 16:9 formats didn't seem like they'd be that useful. But I was completely wrong, and that is the most used switch on my camera; it actually does change the way you'll compose photographs; what was one photo at 16:9 is completely different @ 4:3 or 3:2, landscape vs portrait, etc. Another fun feature : )So, obviously, I like the camera; I've owned it for almost a year now. Best small camera ever made, IMO; this will probably be the benchmark classic folks talk about for years. Yes, I'm quite serious about that, I don't believe these days digital cameras are outdated every 6 months; this one will be quite current for years. If you need a low light, low key, wide angle camera with awesome RAW performance, just pull the trigger. 2 thing's I'd get while buying; a fast 8GB or higher card, and an extra battery (the generic one they sell here is just fine), and you're good to go.","10 28, 2009",A208YEITRPNBH6,Edward V.

I also justified the price by promising myself I would use it while traveling to listen to music and read books (in hotel rooms and on airplanes)...and I might even buy and download a movie to enliven a long domestic flight on occasion. And, of course, for anyone who uses Amazon digital media services even a medium amount,  the price of the Kindle Fire HD is right. $200 is a reasonable investment for a better Amazon Prime experience.And lets clear up the ""real tablet"" thing quickly too. The only reasons I can think of for Mr. Bezos calling the Kindle Fire HD ""the most advanced 7 inch tablet in the world"" are 1) he has never seen a Nexus 7, 2) he is not laying awake at night wondering what the wizards of Cupertino are dreaming up for the iPad Mini, or (perhaps most charitable) 3) he was simply carried away by a parent's justifiable pride at the new prodigy in the family.And lets get that straight too...though it is not a ""real Android tablet"" by a stretch, the Kindle Fire HD is indeed a prodigy! What it does it does brilliantly. Mr. Bezos should have rested his case when he made the ""not a gadget but a service"" argument. It is a brilliant argument...maybe even a winning argument...considering the depth and breadth of Amazon's digital offerings. Only Apple comes close to offering the kind of digital ecosystem Amazon has built, and their need, (whatever its source) to keep the hardware required for access to their domain at a premium price level is becoming harder and harder to justify. Amazon has it right. Put hardware access in easy reach, and let the consumers consume!So, what did they get right with the Kindle Fire HD, hardware wise?1) a brilliant screen that makes watching digital movies and tv shows a pleasure. Yes, slightly less glare, but mostly it is just a very rich screen...vibrant color, excellent detail, easy to look at. Nice!2) sound that puts any other tablet and almost all laptops in the shade. You can actually sit and listen to music on the Kindle Fire HD with some measure of pleasure. Dual stereo speakers and Dolby digital processing works. As I write here, I am listening to Alasdair Fraser and Natalie Haas's Highlander's Farewell. Fiddle and Cello. Not easy music for small speakers. The fiddle is open and detailed without strain, and the Cello has enough body to be satisfying. The sound is good enough so all my various portable speaker solutions for travel will never see the inside of my suitcase again.3) excellent wifi. I know, some reviewers are saying they see no stronger signals or faster speeds...but, for me, that is not the point. In my house we have single router and between 4 and 6 connected devices on all the time (well...not in the middle of the night...but you get the point). About 20 minutes of uninterrupted viewing is all any device in my house can manage when connected to an Amazon Instant Video stream. Then the ""connecting"" thingy comes on and I sit there for up to 60 seconds while it finds the stream again...and often enough I have to close the player and go back to the Resume button to get the video to continue. Yesterday I watched the whole first season of Single Handed,  270 minutes of totally uninterrupted video, on the Kindle Fire HD. Never at stutter. Never a dropped frame. Never a lost connection. Perfect. I attribute that to the quality of the wifi...probably to the device switching over to the second wifi band where there is nothing else going on in our house...and maybe a little to the improved antennas and digital signal wizardry also packed into the Fire's wifi radio. Whatever. It works. I will give you all an update after my next trip. If the Fire improves wifi reception at an airport...well then, that will say a lot!4) an overall build that says, quietly, ""this is a quality product"". It feels good in your hands. It feels solid. It is the right size and shape to hold easily in any position. The buttons I will get used to I am sure. (Almost...at least they are there.) In my opinion it matches the functional build quality of either my Motorola or the iPad...and the smaller size is certainly attractive for travel and easy-chair consumption.Moving then to the user experience interface...remember I am coming from unadorned Android Ice Cream Sandwich and some experience of  iOS 5...well, the Fire it gets the job done. I found it easy to get around, right out of the box, and it certainly an elegant front end for the Amazon Digital Media Services. Some have said it might be easier for the beginner than either straight Android or iOS, and certainly that is correct if all you want to do is connect to Amazon, browse the web a bit, and check your email. Beyond that, I always found both Android and iOS to be pretty intuitive as well.The Email client, while it gets high marks for connectivity (Exchange means you can get email from almost any service that is not firewalled or protected by a VPN), is pretty basic. The layout is annoying in that in landscape fully half the screen is taken up by a useless list of your emails, leaving actual messages jammed into the other half. Any html message will not fit without a lot of scrolling around. This will not be my favorite way of checking email, but it is there if and when I need it.The Silk Browser has never lived up to its hype. I am not sure why. It sounds like a good idea in theory. Again, Silk will never be my browser of choice but it works. You can even access Google+, GMail, Reader, etc. if you really must check into your G-world on your Fire.The standard issue Facebook and Twitter Android clients are as good on the Fire as on anything else...and might be, for whatever reason, just a bit faster. (Or that is my impression...maybe it is that wifi thing again.)Skype is brilliant! Excellent camera and excellent wifi mean an experience at least as good as you can get on your laptop...and for a tablet that is saying much.And, of course, the Books, Music, and Video apps, as portals to the Amazon services, are of the expected quality. (I noticed some lag calling up the keyboard in the search box of the Book Store which I hope they fix, but other than that...). I will be downloading some of my music from the Cloud Player to the device for trips, but I am listening to streamed music here at home and it is perfect. As a reader, the quality of the screen makes a big difference...I won't be carrying my Keyboard Kindle on trips anymore...but then I don't read out of doors anyway.So, conclusions:No, sorry Mr. Bezos,  the Kindle Fire HD 7 is not the most advanced 7 inch tablet in the world...surely the Nexus 7 still claims that title...but as a portal to the whole world of Amazon digital content it is simply brilliant. The right hardware to ensure a quality experience on all fronts. The right software to make digital consumption a pleasure. It really is a service...not a gadget.Gadget lovers (and app addicts) will still far prefer the undisguised Android experience, and there are lots of tablets out there for them. (Though I doubt we are going to see Amazon Instant Video on any of them any time soon.)The better comparison is to the iPad and any possible iPad mini. If you remember the iConcept was originally very like Amazon's current hardware/service concept (except for hardware pricing of course). Remember. iTunes. iPod. When the iPhone came out they did not even intend to allow 3rd party apps! Then the development community just stole the platform and ran away with it...and Apple had the good sense to get out of the way (well...actually...they figured out a way to make a profit off it). Even with addition of TV and Movies to the iTunes experience, over the years the digital media services aspect has taken the back seat to the hardware and to the whole iOS phenomena. Even if Apple has an iPad Mini up their sleeve for the Christmas season, I doubt they will be able, or willing, to match Amazon's hardware pricing.And, honestly, the whole closed, highly restrictive, heavily protected ecosystem of Apple's iTunes and hardware got old for me some time ago. I want to be able to consume the same digital content on whatever device I happen to be using at the moment. Amazon does this right. Apple does not. .That leaves a window for Amazon...a wide open window. They have the digital content. They have the right attitude toward consumption. Now, in the Kindle Fire HDs, they now have a world class delivery system...hardware portals that provide brilliant, easy access...priced so that almost anyone can afford one...priced, in fact, for gifting.I just got my Christmas present early.","09 16, 2012",A1N63P1KY594SY,"Stephen Ingraham ""lightshedder""",78.0,"Not the best tablet, but the best Amazon experience!",33.0,655.0,1347753600.0,1688.0,141.39928962,67.6533280575,73.7459615628,0.0206322358772,0.0,0.872822866025

I've owned DSLRs since 2004, starting with a Nikon D70 and then moving to D40, D200 andCanon Digital Rebel XSi 12.2 MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (Black)andCanon EOS 40D 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only). Those are all excellent cameras, but this Nikon D3100 is better than all of those in one crucial area, the area that matters: it takes excellent pictures without having to fiddle with the settings between shots. Yes, the other cameras are better in other respects: They have more buttons to change settings without delving into menus, they are bigger (is that a plus?), heavier (another plus?), and have better specs (1/500 flash sync speed for D70 and D40), but in the end I would have to fiddle with the settings to get the best results: change the white balance, fiddle with the ISO (my Canons would default to ISO 400 for flash shots, why? Who knows. That meant disabling auto ISO and choosing ISO settings manually), the exposure (+0.7 indoor, 0 outdoor), and so on. D200 was noisy at higher ISO, D70's pictures tended to be cool (i.e. not warm), 40D had cool custom buttons (C1, C2, C3, very cool), but I found its ergonomics worse than XSi or any Nikon; why place the on/off switch at the bottom of the body? Who knows. Fortunately, new Canons have fixed this).This D3100 also makes the D3000 and D5000 obsolete. The D3000 is slow and noisy at high ISO. The D5000 only shoots 720p (not 1080p), no autofocus in movie mode, less resolution. Old technology.What sets the D3100 apart from all the other cameras above is this: set the camera in P (program) mode, auto white balance, -0.3 exposure compensation, slow flash sync mode (for people shots), auto distortion correction on (great!), auto chromatic aberrations correction on (great!), and you are set; now you can concentrate on the only aspect of photography that matters: composition, i.e. framing your shot in the best possible way. There must be a photography mantra that says, ""thou shalt buy the D3100, and the D3100 will set you free."" Now this is if you shot jpeg. If you shoot raw, you can then use a program like DXO,Aperture 3, orAdobe Photoshop Lightroom 3to further play with the pictures. My workflow with the XSi was to shoot raw, then use DXO to batch process all the pics according to two settings: people (low contrast, no saturation added) and landscape (contrast, saturation, etc.). DXO would then batch-remove lens distortion, chromatic aberrations, vignetting, apply custom curves, change white balance when necessary, and apply its (almost magical) auto lighting settings to make the shots pop. For now DXO does not have a custom module for the D3100 (still too new of a camera), so I'm shooting jpeg for now. Once DXO adds the module for the D3100, I'll takes shots in both raw and jpeg fine and compare the jpegs straight out of the camera with the raw images processed with DXO. I'm curious to see the comparison.This is great, not only for you, but also for your non-photographer spouse; my XSi took phenomenal shots, but I had to know how to set it. Can you imagine me going to my non-photographer wife and say, ""okay, when you take indoor shots of our kids, set the camera on A mode (Canons expose for ambient light in A mode and adjust flash for fill, that's great), +0.7 exposure compensation, ISO 400 or 800, white balance on cloudy, and shoot."" My wife was lost at ""okay."" Sure the custom modes on the 40D would have helped, but the 40D is old technology; can it take 1080p video? I didn't think so. Plus, what lens are you going to use with the 40D? The 17-55 IS? Great lens, but who wants to spend $1,000 for a non-weather sealed 17-55 dust collector (google Canon 17-55 and dust)? Will 17-55 be enough for your telephoto shots? Your kids' baseball games? Didn't think so. What about the Canon 18-200? Sub-par quality, noisy, overpriced.Back to the D3100. Auto white balance (the second most important thing after composition) works great, even indoor (no cloudy setting necessary), the only changes are extreme situations (outdoor shade, or indoor fluorescent or tungsten lights at night, but that is true with every camera. Why that is is beyond me; can't they make smarter cameras that account for these situations as well?); movie mode is excellent; yes, the mic is mono, but that's okay for family use (and that's why you buy this camera; if you are pro, you landed on the wrong page); if you really want to push it, you can use this camera for video, your iphone/ipod touch for audio with an app like FourTrack, and then sync video and audio in post with the excellent Singular Software Dual Eyes program. Your choice. Matter is: DSLR video can look awesome if used the right way, but keep in mind its limitations: jerky camera horizontal panning will give you  the infamous jello effect (courtesy of the CMOS sensor), so pan slowly. You'll also have to play with autofocus vs manual focus settings sometimes; I've used the camera in autofocus; it has worked great so far.What lens(es) should you use with the D3100. You should sell the (excellent) 18-55 that ships with the camera. Quality is good, but not enough reach. You can sell it for $140 or so. Take the money and use it toward a more useful lens. What lens? The target market for this camera is moms and dads that want to take shots of their kids; even advanced amateurs like me don't want to travel with a camera bag full of primes and heavy zoom lenses that you have to swap every 10 minutes; this is 2010 (almost 2011), for crying out loud; choose a single zoom and enjoy life and photography; I would use the excellent but underratedNikon 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR ED Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras, the excellent (but expensive)Nikon 16-85mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX ED VR Nikkor Wide-Angle Telephoto Zoom Lens for Nikon DSLR Cameras, or my choice, the jack-of-all trades, theNikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S ED VR II Nikkor Telephoto Zoom Lens for Nikon DX-Format Digital SLR Cameras. Yes, yes, if you check sites like Photozone, they will tell you that the optical quality of the 18-200 is not as good (or consistent) as the 18-105 or the 16-85, but it's good enough for moms and dads bitten by the photography bug. A great shot of your kid at 200mm is better than no shot with either of the other two lenses. The optical superiority of the 16-85 disappears at 135mm or 200mm, simply because it can't do it. The 16-85 and the 18-200 are about the same price. The 18-200 will set you free. It won't help you if your kids play baseball at night (too slow), but you'll have to live with it, unless you are willing to drop $2,000 on aNikon 70-200mm f/2.8G ED VR II AF-S Nikkor Zoom Lens For Nikon Digital SLR Cameras. Sure, we'd all like a 16-300 VR VIII lens with a 20-stop VR reduction, constant 1.4 aperture, with optical perfection, weighing only 500 gr. and below $1,000, but alas our engineers are not as good as the random mutation and natural selection that gave us our eyes ;-0My settings:Display mode: detailed photo info > check RGB histogram and data > Done (why?

This filter is for your travel shots. It will make blue skies bluer and will remove reflections from that gorgeous Maui ocean. This is an expensive filter at $180 or so; you don't have to get it right away, unless you are going to Maui soon.Why 77mm filters? Because you don't want to go nuts buying filters of different sizes for your lenses. If buy the 67mm filter for your 18-105 lens and later decide to upgrade your lens to the 72mm 18-200, you are screwed. It's cheaper to buy a $5 lens ring adapter to 77mm and use 77mm filters. It'll keep you sane too.Remember why you purchase this camera: you want to enjoy photography; enjoy it then.","11 14, 2010",ADVG53CA4FTWI,Macauley86,71.0,Takes excellent pictures and gets out of the way while doing it,540.0,664.0,1289692800.0,1744.0,26.1507450434,12.5239425537,13.6268024897,0.111624615418,0.0,0.873190514273

I've never owned an iPod, but have owned numerous mp3 players (Creative MicroPhoto, MuVo, Nomad, Rio Carbon, etc...). I've always been intrigued by the Zune, so when I saw that it was on sale for $99 at another online retailer, I thought that I'd give it a try and see what all of the fuss is about.I've had the Zune for over a week and have collected the following observations:The Good:* Beautiful, sharp, crisp 3"" screen! Video playback is excellent; no skipping. I've mainly used mp4 and WMV files.* The body feels very solid and durable. I like the brown with green tint; its different from your typical black, silver, or white. The size and weight are fine. I've previously used the Creative Vision:M, which feels like a brick in comparison to the Zune.* The buttons and nav-pad are very easy to use and straight-forward.* I upgraded to the new firmware so that I could get the same functionality as the 2nd gen Zune. The interface is pleasant, simple, and uncomplicated (almost to a fault... but read on.)* Excellent battery life. I was able to last on a single charge over a 4 day trip with frequent usage. I had to charge it on the last day of the trip. I didn't keep track of hours, but it lasted significantly longer than my Creative MicroPhoto. (Make sure that you prime the battery to get the most out of its life. Fully charge the battery as soon as your receive the unit, then use the unit until the battery life is fully depleted. Repeat this a couple of times.)* To shut the unit off, you must hold down the play/pause button for ~3 seconds and then lock the unit with the switch on the top. Otherwise, it is very easy to wake up the unit by pressing any of the buttons and thereby consume precious battery life. There is an auto-off feature that kicks in after a few minutes of inactivity, but again, its easy to wake up the unit. That being said, the unit has an extremely short, almost non-existent start-up time.The Annoyances:* I have experienced skipping with some songs which indicates issues with either the HD, memory, or the sync process. I tried to troubleshoot this on my own, but to no avail (and I do QA as part of my job as a Systems Engineer.)* No plug and play! You must install the Zune desktop player for the unit to be detected by your computer. The unit is not detected as an external drive by Windows Explorer which really sucks as I like to occasionally transfer files between work and home.* The Zune is NOT compatible with Windows Media Player 11. Who was the genius that made this decision at Microsoft? I really don't understand the rationale behind this. It honestly makes no sense. I pray that someday MS comes to its senses and opens up the Zune to WMP11.* The Zune desktop player is very simplistic. Too simplistic. It's an extremely dumbed-down version of Windows Media Player. There is NO advanced tag editing. Ridiculous. I have to do my editing using WMP and then go back to Zune desktop player for syncing.* Zune does not play PlaysforSure media (even MSN Music ... utterly brilliant.) So you're somewhat screwed if you've heavily invested in iTunes, Napster, MusicMatch, WalMart, or 7Digital purchases. To get around this, I used software available online to strip the DRM licensing and convert the files to mp3 format (or whichever format you desire). Its annoying and tedious, but you can do a one-time batch conversion, and then never buy licensed music again. Many of the online music stores, such as Amazon, are now selling mp3s without DRM. I haven't used the Zune Marketplace and can't comment on that. I tend to get all of my music from CDs, Amazon, or 7Digital.* The Zune does NOT recognize playlists created in WMP. It does not recognize .WPL or .m3u files. All playlists are created in a proprietary .ZPL format.* I didn't even bother to play with the Zune video conversion function. I use Movavi to convert DVDs to Zune-compatible WMV files (~1GB for 1 full movie.) Not bad considering you have a 30GB device. I use Crazi Video to convert FLV files from YouTube. Great for capturing music videos. (So at this point, I've probably spent about $60 in DRM-stripping and file conversion software...)* You cannot create video playlists on the Zune or on the desktop player. You can do this in WMP. These come in handy when you have a bunch of music videos or TV shows. If I want to watch another video, you need to go back through the menu, scroll through your videos and select the new one.* The Zune desktop player does NOT detect other USB devices (including MS smartphones.)* The Zune uses a proprietary USB plug. Most mp3 players and devices use the universal miniUSB cable for charging and data sync. The Zune cable is one more cable to carry around.* No AC adapter is included. It takes about 3 hours to charge via USB. Luckily I have an AC charger that can accommodate USB devices.* The battery cannot be removed, so you can't swap out batteries while traveling. The battery life indicator is very basic. It would have been nice to have a more detailed power meter showing % remaining.* IMHO, the wireless function is pointless. The only other person in my social circle that has a Zune lives 1000 miles away. It eats up battery life. And as for wireless syncing: I could see value in this if you don't have your sync cable handy, but I could also see the process consuming a lot of battery power depending on the volume of data being exchanged.* I didn't even bother to use the included earbuds. I use my own Shure E3Cs.* No contacts or calendar sync with Outlook. No CLOCK!!!!!!* The Zune can only display JPG images! `Nuff said.Overall impression: the Zune is an inflexible device with lots of small annoying drawbacks and restrictions. Other than the brilliant screen, its mediocre at best. I tell myself to overlook its flaws for $99 (compared to a $250-300+ Creative or Archos), but its becoming very difficult.I would not pay full price for the new Zune even though the 2nd generation is marginally smaller, slimmer, has a larger screen, and more storage capacity; it still has the same drawbacks as above. If Microsoft would make the device more open and less proprietary (take a hint from Creative) then you could qualify the Zune as an ""iPod killer.""","11 28, 2007",AFVF0IFD0BMIM,"E.

It's a very plain & simple design. Perhaps the only aesthetic touch you'll notice is a navy blue fabric tag on the side that reads ""Roku"" in white font. On the upside, this box will be barely noticeable next to other gadgets in your home entertainment center.When this box is turned on, a very dim bluish light indicator is hardly visible on the front panel. That could be a good or a bad thing depending on how you look at it. Physical button are absent on this box. You're relying solely on the Remote Controller included with your unit. I personally would've loved to see the standard ON/OFF button along with Play/Pause & the Navigation Arrows. Oh well, if your remote gives out you can always buy a replacement unit for $14!Speaking of the remote controller, this bit is equally as simple. It's a flat black plastic brick! It feels fairly solid though. It has Home, Back, Navigation Arrows with the central OK/Selection buttons. It also offers Instant Replay, Info Button, Play/Pause, Fast Forward, & Rewind. Now let's elaborate on this a little more: the controller sits stable on your table. That's a plus. As for the Instant Replay function, it's totally overrated. It only allows you to replay about 5-10 seconds back. I'm doubtful as to how useful that is. I usually use the Rewind Button instead. The Information button on the other hand is nearly as use-less. I contacted Roku's Customer Support to figure out what it does exactly. Guess what, from the Home Screen and as you go through your selection of channels, you press this button & it shows the channel's rating, allows you to re-arrange your channels, shows channel's description, enables to remove it if you so desire. But that's all it does. That's the only purpose this little star (Asterisk) serves on your remote controller. At least for now.Connectivity Options:_____________________Roku rocks in this regard. It covers all the bases. Wireless connection with b/g/n compatibility. It's compatible with N dual-band routers. If paired with a dual-band capable router, it serves for a smoother streaming experience. Wired options include: Component, composite, & Ethernet & HDMI. The HD output is advertised to hit 1080p but you're unlikely to see that. That depends on certain factors: 1) Source quality, & 2) Internet Speed & Connection Type. In my own experience, the best I got was 720p. I'm still happy with that considering I'm using a single band N router. Also worth mention here is that the Roku box scales down the picture quality to keep the video running smoothly. That's, for me, is by far better than having a Full HD that keeps buffering!The XDS also offers some potential feature that only recently was made available natively on your device through a system update. It comes with a USB port for playing video, music & photo content of a thumb drive. Potential is key here. While it doesn't support all music & video format, it's really good to have the option.Installation & Set-Up:______________________Ridiculously simple. You simply connect it to your TV, power it up, choose your Internet connection method of favor (Wired or Wireless) & fellow the on-screen prompts. You should have it up & streaming in a matter of short minutes.User Interface (U.I.) & Content:_________________________________Again, simplicity is King! You'll get easy access to your Settings, Channel Store, & your selected Channels. As for the channels, you have plenty of content to enjoy: Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Video On Demand, CNET TV, Weather Channel, Pandora, MLB TV, NHL Game Center, Newscaster, and the list goes on. Unfortunately though, it's missing content form YouTube!! Shocker, right?! Hopefully, YouTube will be made available through a future update.Although Netflix video data base is huge, I don't think the streaming only plan ($7.99 a month) will satisfy any movie fan out there. Often times I searched a title & was slammed with available on DVD only!! That's when I decided to upgrade to the basic Streaming & DVD ($10 per month) which gives one DVD out at a time along with Unlimited Streaming. DVDs usually arrive within 48 hours depending on your ZIP code. That's, for me, a hell of a better deal. However, I'd much rather a TRUE UNLIMITED STREAMING ONLY PLAN but that's not an option yet.Value:______It's a great value. For a mere $10 a month access to the biggest collection of media content that is Netflix. You can always add up Hulu Plus which is mainly for Series & TV shows. [It would've been greater if Netflix would launch their official app for Android!]Bottom Line:_____________If you want to cut the wires & break loose from Cable companies without sacrificing a good movie night, then Roku is a very solid choice for you. Simple & affordable, good build quality with wide range of content & lots of potential for future improvement. I sure to recommend the XDS version of the 3 models offered by Roku simply because it's more future proof. I sure to recommend this product to a friend.","04 29, 2011",AALWZCFMGNAG1,Keith VanErk,59.0,Roku XDS Streaming Player: In-Depth Review: Revised,7.0,494.0,1304035200.0,939.0,60.5702000669,28.4404167306,32.1297833363,0.0476335392257,0.0,0.872789431278

It does have a few limitations for demanding GPS users that expect the very best and those are also highlighted in this review.  My approach on this review is to offer a long review for those looking for a thorough description of features and details of this unit.  The review has three parts:1.) INCLUDED IN THE BOX2.) PROS3.) and finally CONSWithin the pros and cons I have included what I considered to be the most important on the top of each list with a separate paragraph for each feature if you just want to scan the list and find a feature by it being listed in CAPS at the beginning of each paragraph.INCLUDED IN THE BOX:TomTom VIA 1505TM with Preloaded MapsEasyPort Mount and Adhesive DiskUSB CableCar Charger with Integrated Traffic ReceiverDocumentation (38 Page Manual and Supplemental Page with Lifetime Maps and Traffic Update Code)PROS:SCREEN SIZE:  Having a 5"" screen is certainly handy.  While one gives up a little in terms of portability, having the extra real estate is helpful when trying to navigate a complex intersection / exit / etc.  This is why I personally prefer to use a stand-alone GPS device instead of just a smart phone with a smaller screen for my navigational needs.ADVANCED LANE GUIDANCE:  This may very well be my favorite feature and this device does this better than any other navigational device I have ever seen.  Blinking zoomed in orange arrows appear that show you exactly what lane you should be in at crucial points in the journey.  We have all shared the frustration of having a GPS not give clear notice of the optimal lane to be in when preparing for quick turns at exits, on ramps and junctions.  This unit removes the mystery.  I tested this feature on some tricky intersections and the unit did not disappoint.  I live on a side street off a roundabout and it even handles those types of intersections clearly.  The intersection literally pops up and you are provided with easy to see orange blinking arrows offering guidance.  When approaching exits on interstates / highways, it even transitions to display accurate green traffic signs noting exit numbers and street names when they occur.  The clarity with which this is all displayed really distinguishes this GPS from others in the market and is ingenious.  You will love this feature!VOLUME AND CLARITY:  Volume settings allow one to adjust to a setting that should suit most people's use.  This is a flaw in some GPS units; however, this unit is plenty loud.  Gives you four stock English voices (three female and one male) to choose from and the advertised ability to download more from a Website.USER INTERFACE / EASE OF USE / SCREEN DISPLAY:  As good as anything else I have seen.  Offers all the usual bells and whistles (Route Summary with:  Distance to Next Turn, Time to arrive at destination, Miles to arrive at destination, etc.).  Plus, I love that it lists many possible names of a street when you are driving.  In other words, it gives you the street number AND the street name.  For example, it will list both Major Deegan Expressway and Interstate 87 instead of one without the other.  Anyone driving in unfamiliar territory without this feature will attest to how frustrating this can be.  This really eliminates a great deal of uncertainty and gives me peace of mind.  The touchscreen is responsive; however, it requires a slightly firmer touch than some of my other touchscreens on other electronic gadgets.  It does have at times an annoying delay; however, nothing that I have I found unmanageable.  The screen does not wash out badly even in sunlight (although honestly, I could see where this might be a problem for some in really bright areas).  The screen is easy to read when wearing sunglasses.  It has night settings and other brightness and other color settings and more advanced settings to help compensate for lighting conditions.  It offers a manual zoom feature although it is tricky and not intuitive.  You can change the car icon to any one of several different options.  I also like that it offers you the actual street number instead of just saying you have arrived at your destination.  Seems minor; however, handy for when you forgot the actual address of where you going.  There is a great deal of customization that you can do in the advanced settings.  It really offers a lot of options.  You can switch from a QWERTY keyboard to other format keyboards.  You can even customize it to more user-friendly settings if you are left-handed.SPOKEN STREET NAMES: I remember several generations ago when GPS units first became popular one would pay a premium for this feature.  Glad to see this is now stock with most GPS units as it really makes life easier.  There is a big difference between ""turn right in 100 yards"" and ""turn right on Main Street in 100 yards.""UNIT SIZE:  It is slim and thin.  Even with the attached mounting mechanism it should be compact enough for most people's tasteROUTE RECALCUATION:  Performs these quicklyLIFETIME MAP UPDATES:  Promises 4 map upgrades per year for life (for the useful life of the unit).  I had no trouble checking for updated maps as soon as I hooked the unit to my computer.LIFETIME TRAFFIC UPDATES:  The receiver antenna is in the car DC plug so you must have the GPS device powered in the cigarette lighter for this feature to work.  Uses a color-coded glowing dots traffic sidebar on the right of the device and shows where each traffic accident is along your route.  Differentiates by:  slow traffic, traffic lining up and stationary traffic or road closure.  If a faster route is found, the unit will offer to re-plan your trip.  Look, no device is going to get this 100 percent accurate; however, this device seems to perform well and best of all there are no annoying advertisements like we see with some of the competition.IQ ROUTES:  This routes you around traffic jams based on anticipated traffic around that time of day.  I am still not clear if this just goes by the time of the day or if it integrates information from the traffic updates with this particular feature.  I just haven't played around with this feature enough yet.ROUTE OPTIONS:  Offers you the quickest, and econ (gas saving mode) and even bike and walking routes.  Now that is cool!  The one thing I don't like is I have not yet found a setting that lets you avoid highways or one particular road.  It might be there in the advanced settings; however, again one feature I have just not found yet.POINTS OF INTEREST:  Claims 7 million POIs and as we know many mom and pop establishments don't usually appear; however, it does a fair job of identifying the big boys and I was surprised at how many of the local mom pops actually did appear.HELP ME EMERGENCY MENU FEATURE:  Kind of a nice additional feature that takes POIs to the next level for things (nearest police station, nearest fire station, nearest hospital, nearest car repair service, nearest emergency service, nearest dentist, nearest pharmacy, etc.) you might have to find more quickly in an emergency.  It is a good idea being able to access this under a different menu than the other POIs.  It gives contact information as well as driving and walking directions for each of these locations.  Plus, it even offers a first aid guide and some basic vehicle repair and maintenance instructions!  This is also where the on board product manuals for the GPS device are located.INTEGRATED MOUNT FEATURE:  This one is hit or miss.  I like the feature; however, some will find having a permanent mount unnecessarily adds to the unit's bulk.SPEED CAMERAS:  This is not really a feature I would trust or use that often and I have found several of the speed limits to be inaccurate; however, it is nice to have an idea of what the speed limit is on unfamiliar roads.  It does flash a warning when you are speeding and that might help avoid a ticket.TomTom MAP SHARE:  I have not yet attempted to use this feature; however, it is a nice touch if it indeed works.  Allows certain users who join the TomTom community to update other users of unique things in the neighborhood (like detours and map errors).MyTomTom INTERNET SITE and APPLICATION YOU INSTALL ON YOUR COMPUTER:  Nice Feature to easily download firmware, map updates, etc.  One note to keep in mind for those that skip the owner's manual is you must set up a separate account for each TomTom device you own.  The manual also noted that you must plug in directly to a USB port and not use a USB hub.  I also noticed on my laptop, the device is not recognized unless I am powering my laptop from the power cord (does not recognize the device on laptop battery power).  It gives you a $10 voucher off an accessories purchase if you register your device.  The site claims in the future it will offer funny voice downloads, personalized POIs and the Map Share Changes I previously mentioned.CONS:TIME TO PICK UP AND LOCK INITIAL SATELLITE SIGNAL:  I don't think this is that bad and for most of my uses it is a non issue; however, compared to other units I have had in the past it does take slightly longer (a couple of minutes typically) to pick up a satellite signal when initially powering up the unit.  Plus, the lock in time seems really inconsistent even when in the same geographic area; perhaps a product of weather? (it has been really rainy in my area the month I have used the unit)  I can just see this being an issue on occasion where I am in a really unfamiliar area and need a signal quick (like a rental car lot at a strange airport).STREET VIEW:  Other devices let you bring up the street view of your final destination and actual images / photographs of the house / building you are looking for as your destination point.  That is asking a lot at this price point and might be an unrealistic expectation; however, once you have seen it on another device the cool factor makes it something you want but probably don't really need.CHARGING OPTIONS:  Comes with a DC charger for the car and a USB charger for the computer.  I really wish it came with a regular AC charger (hardly any GPS device does) so I could charge it on a stand-alone basis in a wall outlet at home.  Every GPS unit I have had, or seen, has horrible standby battery time and sometimes you just want to top off the charge when you know your other electronics will be using up the limited AC sockets in your vehicle (particularly rental cars). No big deal here either though since there are after market adapters that I can use with the DC charger to make it into an AC charger.BATTERY LIFE:  This one will vary based on the screen settings you utilize in the custom settings; however, getting more than 2 hours will be a stretch.  Again, this seems typical of most GPS units and is not really an indictment on this unit; however, you would think with advances in lithium ion battery technology we could get longer battery life by now.Bottom line, if you can deal with a slightly slow lock in getting a GPS signal, don't have a problem with a permanently attached mount and can live without having the really cool feature of street views with actual photographs of your destination, this GPS should offer more features than most people will ever need.  TomTom is to be commended for offering so many features at this price point and even throwing in some nice innovation (that Advanced Lane Guidance is awesome).","05 19, 2011",A2DRYHBYLO5S8T,E.

I had read all the specs and seen the pics of the camera, and wanted to find out if it was all style and no substance, or if there really was a heart inside the beast. The shop owners opened the box for me to inspect, attached the screen protector, strap and lens cap string, and I took it for a spin before I even left the shop.Before I say anything more, I'd better let you know my digital camera background. I've been using them ever since they first came out about 10 years ago. Sony DSC-30, Kyocera SL300 (world's first 3.3 fps limited only by size of memory card), Nikon S4, Canon 350D, Nikon s10, Nikon P90, Pentax k-x. In addition, I have always used mobile phones with cameras- xcute (world's first 3 mpxl mobile phone camera), SE k810, k850, Motorola ZN5, Samsung Innov8, SE Satio. So i've used a wide range of digital cameras.Initial feeling:1. Camera felt lighter than I expected, even with the 4 AA batteries in place.2. Solid plastic, yet at the same time a little hollow.3. Great grip- right side hand grip is deep and rubberised for gripping.4. Thankfully the lens cap has a string attaching it to the shoulder strap- no chance of losing it or wondering where to put the cap when you take it off.5. Lots of buttons at the back. Going to have to refer to the manual quite a bit.6. The ""chrome"" ring on the bottom right feels a bit cheap. Though I guess use of plastic helps reduce the weight.7. It's amazing how friendly store people can be once you buy something from them. I was dripping sweat- hot day, so they gave me a cup of water :)8. The screen is beautiful. I can't say it enough. It's very clear and bright, even with screen protector on.9. The lens has an INCREDIBLE zoom range- 24mm to 720mm (35mm format) and feels very smooth when you manually zoom.10. Zooming ring has good grip, but the pattern isn't attractive.11. Shop owner told me the lens is 58mm diameter- that's good because I can use my IR and UV filters.12. Electronic view finder is ok, but I find for ""bridge"" cameras they tend to be small in size. Only the dslr's have eyepieces which are a good size which is comfortable for your eye. Ignoring the size, the EVF quality is good, and you may have read about the sensor next to it, which activates the EVF when you bring your eye to it. So the 3 inch LCD screen turns off and the EVF turns on when you bring your eye to the EVF.What about the photos?13. Really good. I've taken about 100 photos so far, mostly at night. You have to be quite steady, even with the shake reduction function on (there are 4 options for shake reduction!!!), especially at the maximum zoom. But if you are, then the photo is very very good and sharp. Not quite as sharp as the Pentax k-x, which is known for it's low light performance, but it's pretty damn good. It's certainly good enough for me. Colours seem accurate and bright. Focusing in good light was pretty fast. Focusing in low level light was slower. In poor light it might even hunt for 2-4 seconds and flash a focusing light. It takes about 1 to 3 seconds to save a photo, so it's not high speed unless you use that function.14. The focusing is active. That is on auto, it will focus on faces, and even if those people are moving around, you can see the focus square remain glued to their face. My friends had to move side to side pretty fast for the HS-10 to lose the lock.There are so many fancy functions on this camera that I have really only just scratched the surface of what this baby can do. But I'm very glad to say there is substance in the HS-10. If you are in the market for a bridge camera, the HS-10 should definitely be on your shopping list.Added 15th April 2010.----------------------Despite the overcast and rainy conditions which plague me whereever I go, I've taken another 120 odd photos during the  periods of ""only"" cloudiness and intermittant sunshine.15. The photos are 24mm and at 720mm have differing sharpness. Colour is good for both though.At 24mm, you can see the whole photo, but you quickly see grainy outlines when you try to zoom in.At 720mm, the photo remains surprisingly sharp when you enlarge or zoom in on the photo. Not quite the same sharpness as my Pentax k-x, but much better than I expected.16. I've always had high zoom cameras and each time I buy up, I get surprised by how much closer I can get to a subject. This time though, I noticed something new. Usually, if I take a photo at the widest angle and then one at max zoom, you can see how much closer you can zoom in because you can usually see the surroundings around the object to compare with.This time however, you can zoom in on something that looks like a little dot in the 24mm photo and it's so close that you literally can't tell it's a zoomed up photo because it looks like a totally different photo.eg: I was on an overhead walkway and took a 24mm photo of the road. A traffic light was about 400 metres ahead. I zoomed in and I got a clear photo of the back of 2 cars and the licence plates. You'd think I had been standing just 5 metres away with a normal camera it was so good.In another example, I took a 24mm pic of an outside wall of a very colourful shopping centre. It's about 6 storeys high, so ground floor shop windows look like dots. When I zoomed to 720mm through the window, I got a very clear photo of the inside of the shop, with no reference to the outside of the building wall at all.This zoom is POWERFUL.I have no idea what the next generation of zoom lenses will allow us to do when they go to, say 850mm, 1000mm plus!17. f stops seems pretty good.I can take close ups of flowers and have both foreground and background nicely out of focus.18. Do keep a steady hand. Brace yourself against a pole or solid object if you can. It really helps in taking a sharp photo. It has good image stabilisation, but it's not a miracle worker.Thanks again all for reading :)Update 1st May 2010-------------------19. I've taken a few more photos and can say the following. The daytime photos are good. Not quite as good as my Pentax kx, but good. Sharpness, colour, detail are all more than acceptable. The lens is great for portraits, and the zoom speaks for itself. The tiltable screen makes the camera much more versatile than a fixed screen camera too.20. There are two areas that I find the camera disappointing.The first is the time needed to save each photo- 2 to 3 seconds. It's pretty slow. In comparison, my Pentax kx is just take the photo and instant save. Granted, most non dslr cameras are also non instant picture saving, but it seems even slower than my Nikon s10 and Kyocera sl300r, or even my Motorola ZN5 mobile phone.The second is photo viewing software. Firstly, it's not so easy to view multiple photos because it enlarges the picture you have the cursor on, so it covers the photos next to it. Secondly, as has already be noted by some disappointed reviewers, deleting a photo takes you right back to the end. If you've got hundreds or thousands of photos, that's a real irritant. It's true that holding down a direction on the chrome ring will very very quickly flick through the photos to get you back to where you were, but it's a real hassle.At least on the other hand, when you connect to the computer, there is only 1 folder for the photos, unlike my nikons, which have numerous folders ""100dscn"", 200dscn"" etc.21. Finally, I've taken a few videos and I've found the HD vids all look smooth on the camera LCD, but very jerky, kind of frame by frame, when i play on my computer. I don't have this problem if I record in 640 x 480 (320?) format though. It's probably my computer being old, but I wonder if anyone else has this problem?Thanks again for reading :)Edit 19th April 2011--------------------I ended up selling my HS10 last year for two main reasons. Writing times were too slow, and the software for reviewing photos was poor. I mean- deleting a photo and taking you to the very end again is pretty bad when you've got hundreds or thousands of photos on your card.But the reason I'm adding a bit here is that I've been following the reviews of the Fujifilm HS20, which was released recently. It seems to have taken care of most of the problems I mentioned- quicker writing speed, and viewing and deletion of photos, and added a new problem instead- overheating of some part of the camera, which causes the camera to cease working. I can say that for all the hundreds of photos I took with the HS10, I never had overheating for a problem.Such a pity that Fujifilm can't get such a fantastic camera right.","04 8, 2010",AOXU46P5BRW2I,Adrian,82.0,I'm really impressed with the new HS-10.,281.0,633.0,1270684800.0,1695.0,25.1071112661,12.3492850463,12.7578262198,0.118212612348,0.0,0.873072228947

I wanted something I can take with me everywhere but still produces good quality shots. I also wanted a camera that could shoot good looking videos. I researched several models and after much deliberation decided on the Canon 300 HS. I'm very happy I did.Image Quality:I tested cameras and lenses all the time while managing the camera store so whenever I purchase a new camera or lens I always test it. The Canon 300 HS doesn't produce the quality of images my Nikon D7000 does but I didn't expect it to. The edges get a little soft with the 300 HS when looking at the image at 100% whereas the D7000 images are almost tact sharp.Comparing the 300 HS to the Canon Powershot SD1000 from a few years ago, the 300 HS blows it out of the water. The SD1000 is a 7 MP camera. Shooting the same shots on a tripod with the same focal length on the lens the 300 HS uses its extra MPs well. When looking at the images from each camera at 100%, at the wide angle zoom setting and normal zoom setting both cameras have about the same relative slight softness on the edges. However the 300 HS has more MP so it actually produces much more detail in the image. I think it was smart for Canon to keep the MP at 12 because last years models while being 14 MP (SD1400) didn't give any extra detail from what I could tell than the 12 MP version (SD1300). The SD1400 was basically just creating larger files. When zooming in the telephoto setting the 300 HS clearly produced a sharper image than the SD1000. Often cameras have sweet spots in the zoom range in which it will produce crisper images. The 300 HS has consistently good sharpness throughout it's zoom range.HS system and ISO:The image processing with the HS system truly works to reduce noise at higher ISOs enabling people to produce better quality images in low light. The improvement in image quality gets more and more visible the greater and greater the ISO. ISO 400 with the 300 HS was almost as good as ISO 200 on the SD1000. ISO 800 on the 300 HS was a tad better than ISO 400 on the SD1000. ISO 1600 on the 300 HS was between ISO 400 and 800 on the SD1000. ISO 3200 on the 300 HS produced the same quality of image (noise) as ISO 800 on the SD1000. A 2 stop in film speed improvement is big.1080p video and slow motion:With good light, the 300 HS produces wonderful smooth 1080 videos. If you look at a lot of HD videos from compact cameras the video often looks jumpy. From what I've seen it wasn't until you got to the Canon G12 or Panasonic LX5 that the video looked smooth. Both of those cameras only shoot 720p whereas this camera shoots 1080p. The video also very good detail. It truly looks HD.If you are wanting zoom and continuous AF with your video this camera is the one you want compared to the 100 HS which doesn't allow you to zoom. The continuous AF with face recognition is stellar with this camera in video mode. I was videoing my wife while she was driving. It focused on her face. I switched to the scenery outside. It immediately focused on that. I then went back to my wife and it found her face and focused on it right away. I even videoed her reflection in the rear view mirror and it found her face in the mirror no problem and focused on it. AMAZING!!!!Commenting on a complaint I've read about the zoom being slow in video mode. If you like getting motion sickness whenever someone rapidly zooms in or out during their video this is not your camera. As smooth looking as the video is, the zoom is also. The smooth zoom creates nice looking transitions instead of warp speed ahead looks.The slow motion is a fun feature that works well. You need to have good lighting though. In low light even with high ISO's it produced very dark videos. In a review someone commented that it should have sound with the slow motion video. I honestly don't know how that could work unless you want to listen to everything at 1/5 it's normal speed. I think it's a good thing that it doesn't have sound with the slow motion videos.AF:I commented on AF partially in the video portion of the review. It does have several AF modes for various situations. The face detection works great. If you have a person in the picture but want something other than the person to be in focus you will need to change AF modes from face detection. The reviewer that had the problem with the 300 HS focusing on things he didn't want the camera to focus on likely didn't have the correct AF mode for the shooting situations. The 300 HS does have a center AF if you prefer that.Areas for Canon to improve on with the 300 HS:The camera is so well thought out that I'm surprised Canon let this slip. I love having a wide angle zoom go down to 24mm. It's great for scenery and photojournalist type shots. If you shoot at the widest angle zoom and use the flash, the lens on the 300 HS blocks the flash's exposure on the bottom right corner of the image. The corner is completely black. If you zoom in a bit so you aren't at the widest angle setting when using the flash you will be fine. Still all Canon had to do is not put the flash so close to the lens.When shooting video in lower light situations the video does start to get noisy and grainy quicker than some other cameras.Conclusion:All in all this is a wonderfully thought out camera with great image quality and image processing and it shoots stellar videos for it's compact size.","03 19, 2011",A1WUQF5HWBAQJU,JJG,55.0,Wonderful compact camera with hd video,1875.0,381.0,1300492800.0,1059.0,26.1098303057,12.760500717,13.3493295887,0.113209879908,0.0,0.873046638114

I purposely waited to purchase the PRO over the RT version because I knew that the PRO was a full function computer.I needed/wanted a Windows tablet as I work for myself and I wanted a more portable solution. I frequently may need to work with my staff while from a remote location and I also need to work on Office documents and access files from my desktop computer.I have tried (and tried) to use my Ipad and while it offers functionality, nothing beats a Windows Machine. I also wanted a more 'airport friendly' device than a laptop. I'm tired of dragging it out for TSA and trying to beat the other 100 travelers trying to get their shoes and belts back on.I have owned the Surface for 2 days and I couldn't be more pleased. I 'tried' it out by taking it to an office training class, and streaming the web training session, all the while working with my office and answering emails, and looking up accounts.I have set up my computer (Yes I don't call it a tablet) with the office 365 trial, and I have been able to create documents, save to my computer and skydrive and send out via email. Ah!The ONLY issue I have had with my Surface is that my Outlook would not open (the profile) would not open AT ALL. I have been searching in vain for the reason for it, and without getting too technical here I believe it is an issue with the Surface. Google it.I have however, been able to set up the mail and calendar app, and yes it works perfectly, so in retrospect, I don't really need outlook.To answer most FAQs:1. Yes it is small. Too small? No, just right. It is supposed to be portable. Just adjust browser and document settings and you are good to go.2. IT IS A COMPUTER, MORE THAN A TABLET. You have full function capabilities that you would have in a desktop/laptop. I have installed programs, and yes I use a mouse. You actually can use it without a mouse, however I think the combo of tablet gestures and mouse works. I like the wedge mouse, it's small and Bluetooth, so no dongle sticking out of the ONLY usb port.3. I am using the type cover. It is a respectable keyboard and easy to use. I would use this over anything else, since the keyboard is the cover and when you fold it back it disables the keys and you don't accidentally type as its folded back.4. Using it without the keyboard cover is good too. I am actually liking the windows 8 tiles, which took a little getting used to. But now I wish I had windows 8 on my desktop. I lay in bed and use the Surface frequently without the keyboard and it is a good tablet.5. Screen is glossy and gets fingerprinty fast. Use of mouse and the pen works but only so much. I wish the pen had more of dedicated holding spot instead of the charging port. I can see myself losing it, and soon. I bought a carrying case to hold all of the accessories when not in use. Screen protector will probably work to cut down some of the fingerprints but I haven't gotten one yet.6. Battery life.....eh. Not awesome. Today I used the surface while working and it lasted about 5 hours. I did not decrease the screen brightness as I like it high regardless. Yes, I would carry my charger with me.7. Charger has a usb slot to charge another device while charging your Surface. Pretty awesome. I used this to charge my phone while I needed my phone's hotspot to get internet for the Surface the other day.8. It is not a TOY. This is not a kid's tablet or play toy. Yes you can get apps (all types from games to business) but it is a full function portable computer. I'm mad I didn't think of purchasing this for my high school daughter instead of her ipad that she takes to school every day to take notes on.9. Love the kickstand. Some people hate the kickstand, I however think it is perfect for sitting in a chair or laying in bed and not having to prop it up or have some bulky case on it to prop it up. Don't want it, push it in, done!10.I have not watched any movies or played any games on it, and I probably won't. I'm just not a game or movie tablet watcher unless i'm on a airplane.11. It gets a little hot. The battery gets a little hot and its a little heavy. But we are all used to the slim weight of the Ipad and android tables, but compared to a laptop its not heavy, at least to me.12. It is not comparable to an Ipad or any other type of tablet. It is a computer. You will be disappointed if all you are getting it for is to play angry birds.13. Side note about Skydrive (Microsoft's cloud drive) if you set it up on the computer you use and the Surface you can choose/open documents that are saved in the Skydrive as well and the documents that are stored locally on the respective computer. I just found this out today, and it has a great feature. No longer do I need to use Log me in, or the remote desktop tool on the Surface.14. There was an HP Printer app on my Surface which allowed me to connect to the HP Printer in my home right away. I was able to print in seconds, from email, documents, etc.14. I typed this whole review on my Surface, while sitting on my patio.Conclusion: This a a great solution to the tablet world and the real computing world. I'm sad that microsoft wasn't first to market, then everyone would be comparing everything else to this and not the Ipad.","05 3, 2013",APMAMNLZCQJ76,"NicoleReviewsItAll ""I Heart Books""",61.0,Pro Solution!,13.0,428.0,1367539200.0,1065.0,58.8281535126,29.904731683,28.9234218297,0.0515727195307,0.0,0.872861305017

It feels heavier by far than the 18-55mm kit lens, but lighter than I expected. Feels good (well-balanced) cradling the lens in the left hand near the base of the lens when mounted to my Canon Digital Rebel XT. I put the lens on the camera right away in a manner that would limit the opportunity for dust to intrude on the back of the lens or into the camera, since I've read about this lens not being sealed as well as ""L"" series Canon lenses. I may never take it off. 8-)This lens focuses fast and sure--even in low light, no hunting around to lock onto a subject. Pictures taken with the camera hand-held at 1/10 to 1/15 sec shutter speeds inside with no flash were tack-sharp (Thanks to the IS). With F2.8 and IS, this lens opens up a whole new world of natural low-light photography. Not only are more inside shots possible, you also have the versatility to create gorgeous bokeh. You create these bokeh effects generally zoomed to 55mm (where the kit lens' max aperture is F5.6). Since the EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 has a constant F2.8 max aperature, you don't have to worry about the depth of field increasing as you zoom. It is so confidence-inspiring to walk around and set your aperture where you want it to give you the depth of field you want, and not really worry about the shutter speed being too slow. Some of my outside dusk (low-light) shots at 1/6 sec shutter and F22 came out sharp (Thanks again to IS). I almost got vertigo when I first looked at my pics uploaded to my PC--they were so realistic. Images really pop!The decision to go with this lens instead of some of the ""L"" grade lenses involved the following criteria:1. Focal Length Range.  I wanted at least the range of the 18-55mm kit lens.2. Max Aperture.  I wanted f/2.8, since f/4 is too confining for low-light situations. Also, f/4 doesn't give you the depth of field limiting ability of f/2.8. Trade-off is size and weight (and price).3. Constant Max Aperture.  I wanted a constant max aperture throughout the zoom range. I don't want to set the aperture and have the camera stop it down due to the max aperture decreasing as you zoom in (as is the case with the kit lens).4. USM.  I wanted the Ultrasonic Motor (USM) feature, since this is known to be the fastest and quietest autofocus technology.5. IS.  I wanted Image Stabilization (IS), since this effectively makes your lens faster, because you can shoot in lower light at lower shutter speeds without fear of blur (provided the subject is still). Also, zoomed-into 55mm, camera shake can be more of a problem than at shorter focal lengths. IS has got you covered there as well. This lens only has one IS mode (no mode for panning).6. Full Format or Crop-optimized. It is true that going with a full format lens would mean that you could use it on any DSLR (35mm film, APS-C DSLR, and Full Format DSLRs such as the 5D and 1Ds Mark II). However, full format lenses are not optimized for the 1.6x crop of the Canon DSLRs Rebel through 30D. The crop-optimized lenses (designated by the ""EF-S"" in the model name) are tailored to the smaller image sensors of the APS-C camera bodies. The lens elements and coatings are designed to minimize the ghosting and flare that can come from reflections off of the image sensors in digital cameras. Also, the crop-optimized lenses tend to be smaller, lighter and less expensive than otherwise identical full format lenses.  I considered the EF 17-40mm f/4L, the EF 24-70mm f/2.8L and the EF 24-105mm f/4L. But, none of these had the focal length range I wanted, and two of them weren't fast enough (f/4), and the EF 24-70mm f/2.8L was very heavy (2.1 lbs). I determined there was no need to sacrifice performance now for some possible benefit later on if I purchase a full format camera. If I ever do, I would hope there would be full format lenses that have been designed to limit chromatic aberrations and introduce other digital optimizations currently provided by the crop-optimized APS-C format-only lenses. Besides, you can always continue to use your old camera and lens as a back-up, or you can sell them to help purchase the new ones.7. Grade (""L"" series or Advanced Amature).  Of course, if all else is equal, take the ""L"" lens with the red stripe. But, all else is not equal. I'd rather have an optically superior lens that is well-built (although not as well as an ""L"" series) that meets all my other criteria, and just be careful to keep the dust out. The EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 is expensive (I paid $[...] on [...]). But, I'm sure if there were an ""L"" series version of this lens, it would be even more expensive.Conclusion:  This is one great lens! There's nothing else out there for 1.6x crop digital cameras that gives you the sweet spot of zoom range, low light capability, depth of field control, image stabilization, fast and quiet auto-focus, and superior image quality rivaling prime lenses. And to put the considerable weight (22.8 oz.) into perspective, it is still 3.8 oz. lighter than the very good digital-only Nikon 17-55mm f/2.8, and the Nikon does not even have image stabilization (and costs more to boot).  Game, set and match!UPDATE 2/3/07:  I've taken 1000+ pictures. I'm impressed with battery life given that I thought IS would use a lot of power. But, since flash is nearly never needed (due to f/2.8 and IS), battery life has seemingly been extended. I didn't realize how much I would grow to expect a stable image through the viewfinder until I looked through a viewfinder with a lens without IS and saw the image shaking. Note that cameras with built-in image sensors (such as Sony Alpha) don't stabilize the viewfinder.  The EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM autofocus locks-on amazingly fast even in low light. No apparent optical weak spots at any focal length or aperture. Lens hood (optional) eliminated most, but not all, flares from bright sun. I think this is the best, most versatile walk-around lens you can get. I wish Canon would make an EF-S 55-200mm f/2.8 IS USM lens to pair it with so I could zoom in closer on distant wildlife, etc.","12 28, 2006",A2BZF12UZ53GAU,Steven A.

I'm really good about updating so I feel confident that if anything changes I will keep you guys posted.First off, this tv looks stunning even without the power on. The good news is, it looks just a beautiful with the power on. The 240hz paired with the Trumotion feature is outstanding. The apps work flawlessly and with plenty of speed. I've heard people say that they don't offer many apps and that is true, but the apps they do supply are mastered very well. Plus, all the apps that most people actually use are available (Netflix, Vudu, Hulu etc.)Also the internet browsing is pretty darn fast too. I also saw major complaints about the remote, but I have to admit I went into this tv already loving this feature because I am a Wii lover. One tiny complained about the Magic remote, it's a little fidgety. The remote is just a minor (very minor) problem. The remote works pretty well other than it can be a little jerky at times.The picture is amazing. The factory settings for this tv are great, I haven't had to change a thing(except I did put all my Trumotion settings to Extra Clear).Even without the 3d mode on it still looks like the images are dancing off the screen. The image control is very smooth and clear. It's literally like looking through a window. The sound is pretty good too. I was expecting to have to run out and get a sound bar but now I'm thinking I'll save the money, because the sound is very acceptable. The stand and the ultra thing tv look awesome.The 3d mode is pretty cool, especially the 2d to 3d function. I honestly don't care about 3d, but after playing around a bit with the 3d I am now pretty excited to have it.The apps and the wifi internet are very speedy and make for a very picture perfect viewing experience. I am a picture nut, so I need the apps to run at as close to blu-ray standard as possible, and this tv's apps passed with flying colors. The menus are a little sloppy but nothing that I'm sure a little extra time to conquer won't resolve.One cautious note of advice, I have read many concerned about bleeding a flashlighting and it is true. The good news is it does not seem to effect my viewing experience. I can only really notice it when the screen goes dark to set up the menu, but I played some dark movies and the bleeding was completely unnoticeable. I will keep this post updated if that changes though.With all that I've said I can't think of any good reason why this (in my case) tv should not deserve a well earned 5 stars. I got this tv because I recently had issues with my Samsung 6100 model tv, and boy am I glad I made the switch to LG. This tv delivers big time. If anyone has questions about this tv or any info on setting let me know.*****UPDATE*****I noticed a few reviews saying things like ""great, when you finally get a good one"". Since buying this tv I am now on my third 55LM7600. There seems to be some sort of packing issue, so not all people will be effected. The first two tv's had dead pixels (reaffirmed by LG sponsored Tech). The first one I bought had a small amount of bleeding and a small cluster of dead pixels that could not be revived. The second had zero bleeding but still a cluster of dead pixels. Finally the third one had no dead pixels and it was completely perfect. I got a keeper.The reason this update does not change my score is because its due to the technology. More and more tv's are getting slimmer and more sophisticated. You will likely find this issue with any tv. I am a realist when it comes to new technology. I understand that these tv's are fragile and you can't predict shipping malfunction. I do on the other hand think it may also have something to do with the packing.So with all that being said, I still stand firm on my rating. Even with the first two defective models (which were easy enough to take back and get one that did work) I would still put this tv head to head against any tv on the market. As long as you go into this buy with the idea that you may have to find one that was not damaged during delivery, you will be completely satisfied. This is not the first (or even second) time this has happen to me. I had a Sony Bravia show up one time with 6 dead pixels. No company is immune to delivery defects. Expect tv's to become more and more fragile as time moves on too. Rest assured though, you can always try again. After buying this tv and the first one having issues I was so convinced that this was a great tv I went right back up to the store and got the same model, and when it happened again I still didn't hesitate. Now on my third one I am truly happy I stuck to my guns. Being realistic on delivery issues is key.*******Update 2******I have found some settings that most represent what calibrators are looking for in good picture quality. You can find these on a certain website (lcdbuyingguide), where professionals have already taken the time to get your tv to the best picture quality. I've found that these setting work great in both a well-lit room and in a dark setting. This calibration gives you both the color and the contrast that I think are missing from the presettings (although the presettings are actually really, really good on this tv too).

I found it's a happy medium.Oh, and see how well you might like the Clear Plus feature. I like it, but it doesn't suite all program needs. Sometimes it is necessary to low the refresh rate down. You'll see as you go.Hope these help. Let me know if they do or don't.

I won&#8217;t be denied.  Not on a day as momentous as this.  Anywho.  I will get one in a few years.  I went with the PS4 at launch.  No big fanboy reason.  It&#8217;s that after 3 RRoD I don&#8217;t trust Microsoft.  I don&#8217;t think that this machine will have the failure rates but I am a woman scorned.  Rationality has no place in my relationship with Microsoft at this point.  Try and win my heart back you cold monster if you dare!First impressions first.  Yep, it looks like a VHS and that&#8217;s not just a cliche.  I too had that first thought pop up in my head when Microsoft did their big reveal.  Big whoop and all but it&#8217;s a story I tell to this day.  Still though who cares what any of these devices look like.  I stick it in the entertainment center and then keep the little glass door shut on it.  It&#8217;s form is to be ignored; that is it&#8217;s true functionality.  As for my impressions of it&#8217;s packaging and all the silly frivolity of unboxing videos I&#8217;ll save those comments for the next iPad gizmo release.As for the Controller.  I dunno.  No need to have an opinion on everything.  From the pictures and varied range of opinings from across the grand vast ocean of the Internet enough black ink has been spilt.  I like the Xbox360 controller.  Heck, I loved it.  But it still wasn&#8217;t the Dreamcast controller and neither is this newest iteration.  But it beats the Atari 2600&#8217;s one button, one joystick set up.  So it has that going for it.The Big Home Theater integration.  Guess I&#8217;d have my heart in the whole endeavor if I had a cable box, surround system, 3D blu ray player, Tivo and a Ouya to plug into the Xbox One to exert it&#8217;s great will over.  But I got an RCA antenna sitting on the floor that catches 11 channels when the screen door is open and the wind blows right.  Me thinks there isn&#8217;t a jack in the back of the Xbox One for it though.  Otherwise my game system is the only component of the Home Theater in my apartment.  And I ain&#8217;t gonna hook up my PS4 into the back of the Xbox One.  Don&#8217;t seem right in fact it seems a tad bit like a cat and dog engaging in unnatural relations.  Probably should be illegal from a certain point of view.Onto the games.  And isn&#8217;t this that should matter.  Yep, the one thing that tugged at my morbidly blackened heart strings to almost nearly quite but not sway me to the Xbox One is Forza 5.  That&#8217;s gonna easily be the pinnacle of the new gen launch games.  Better than DriveClub had that come out in time.  But I&#8217;m putting my money down on the long end game.  I prefer the PS3 exclusives to the Xbox 360s.  Love me some Forza Horizon and Gears of War and Alan Wake but PS3 had games I preferred a weensy tad bit more.  Just an opinion based in nothing more than my personal preferences.  On a side note: about Quantum Dynamics by Remedy.  It ain&#8217;t coming out for 5 years.  They promised the Alan Wake game to be released in the 360 launch window and 5 years later it finally landed.  Learn your lessons people.  See the pattern.But what about the Kinect you may ask.  I for one welcome the intrusion of an all seeing &#8216;EYE&#8217; into my home and yours.  The day is coming so why not embrace it now?  Big Brother isn&#8217;t the apparatus of the government; he&#8217;s pure commerce.  If Big Brother keeps track of what I buy, what I like, what I want then so be it.  Better ads targeted at me.  I don&#8217;t want to be sold stuff I won&#8217;t be buying.  So to Big Brother I say thank you.  And if the Kinect were to be constantly on  and watching me as I wander aimlessly around my apartment in various states of undress I&#8217;ve got nothing to hide.  And if you want to see it be my guest.  Otherwise as for the Kinect&#8217;s use in games and doing what I want I&#8217;m taking a pass.  All them promises Big Tech companies promise us all so many half-fulfilled meandering idealisms of what may happen but we all know won&#8217;t.And that leads to all the other things the Xbox One is supposed to be doing. Fantasy Football integration.  Skyping.  Sharing game videos on Youtube et al.  The vast majority of everybody won&#8217;t be using none of these things.  It&#8217;s pure hype.  Sounds great, works terrible.  But by all means, if you&#8217;re sold on these things than have a blast.For the final humdinger of a rant I gotta say that both PS4 and Xbox One have set a horrible precedent by increasing the friends limit.  Letting me add 2000 friends to my friends list is something I don&#8217;t want.  I&#8217;m not playing video games cause I have a wealth of friends.  I don&#8217;t want to wander into some virtual lobby to play some FPS combat game and then get inundated with a bunch of friends requests.  It&#8217;s gonna be worse than spam or pop up windows back in the glory days of AOL.  It&#8217;s gonna be a major annoyance.  I don&#8217;t want friends on my video game accounts.  More friends just means more people wanting something out of me and my heart is only so big.Final Thoughts.  Isn&#8217;t it rather presumptuous for any of us to write reviews of products on Amazon in the first place.  I think most people that are writing these XBOX One reviews are either showing off that they bought one (and bully for them cause they were either intelligent enough to pre-order one or stood in line while the rest of us work for a living.)  The other people writing it don&#8217;t own one (just like me!) but they want to muddle the shiny pool of gleaming watery hope for the people who do.","11 22, 2013",A6AT9WIGOXKRP,"Whipple McTeelson the Third ""Purveryor of Mad...",75.0,Here it Is cause it is Here,51.0,481.0,1385078400.0,1115.0,92.3368136605,46.5168380282,45.8199756323,0.0326544590761,0.0,0.872706379375

I've only had it 3 weeks and I am still learning.Things I like.-I love this lens!  At this price point you will not be able to find a lens anywhere that is this good.  This is an enormous zoom range and there is very little distortion or color error at it's zoom extremes.  No, it's not perfect, but I think they hit the perfect compromise between cost and performance.  If they had tried to stretch this zoom any further, like to say 20X, I think they would have ruined it.  Zooms with this range give up a lot and this one gives up as little as possible.  To see what I mean, take a sheet of aluminum foil (shiny side up) and crumple it into a ball and lay it in bright, high noon sun.  Then photograph it at full zoom and then look at the shot with the 16X digital zoom and you will see very little color. Mostly a little bit of violet or light blue.  If I photograph a white bird in bright sun, I get a print of a white bird.  I am not suggesting this is APO performance, just that this is a very good lens on a camera that only cost me $257.00.  It stands out among it's competitors.-I like the flash...it's good enough that I don't need or want an external flash.  So far the furthest I have tried is 26 feet in a darkened room and it did fine.  Some burn out on close up light colored objects but I am still in the learning process. With a partial discharge or used as a fill flash it recycles quickly.  (In comparison to its competitors).-I like having manual controls and the ability to do time exposures.  (the limit is 1 minute) And I like the overall flexibility of the programs.  I like the Intelligent Auto mode and find it gets it right most of the time.  Color balance is great.  Shots taken under store, office, and home lighting look just fine. I have not gotten the swing of the aperture and shutter priority modes yet.  I am still struggling trying to translate this digital language into the 35mm film language in my head.-I like the viewfinder and being able to adjust it for my eyes.-I am impressed with the battery life and like it that the camera came with everything I needed but the SDHC card.-Overall I like the quality of the video.  Units made after July 2008 got an upgraded sound system (according to the insert in box) and my videos can't be played on cameras made before that date.  The sound is not great but it's OK.  We were on the tarmac at Dekalb Peachtree airport and I was filming the news helicopters coming in at the end of the day.  They were about 250 feet away and I could still hear my sons voice and the voice of one of his flight instructors over the sound of the choppers.  I did not get to listen to the older version of this camera so I can't make a comment by comparison.-The speed of the camera...sometimes it's fast as lightning...more on that.  I am using a Panasonic class 4 SDHC memory card (minimum recommended speed for HD video).  The class 4 card sped up the time between shots quite a bit as compared to the internal memory. So I'm going to order a class 6 card and see if it goes any faster between shots.-Super light weight.  (The Canon was a monster to lug around). I can carry it for hours without issues. Not around my neck but in a jacket pocket or on my hip.Things I don't like.-To my dry winter hands it is a little bit too slippery to hold.  I wish it had a rubberized body.  My perception of the build quality is that if I drop it 4 feet onto concrete I am going to do some serious damage. I would be surprised if it survived. To be fair though, in the past, when I have dropped electronic items, the lighter the object the better it tends to fair.  It just feels and looks like hard plastic and not at all like the Canon SX10IS.-The focusing is maddening at times.  Usually it is really fast...and then other times it slowly goes all the way in and then all the way back out before locking.  I have not had it long enough to figure out a way around this but it bugs me.  I almost bought the Canon SX10IS over it because of this.-The internal menu screens do not follow a consistent pattern from one program to another so I can spend a lot of time hunting for what I want.-In the video mode any point of light that is a bit brighter than the back ground will cause a vertical light streak.  The landing light on the channel 46 news helicopter caused a vertical streak and it was still daylight.  The Christmas tree lights caused vertical streaks in a darkened room.  If I brighten the room a bit before filming to eliminate the contrast the streaks disappeared.-I would have liked a folding LCD screen for when I am holding the camera above my head.  The quality of the LCD is just OK by the newest standards.Summary:  I am happy with it and would buy it again. It's a feature rich camera that takes great pictures.  (And the video is not to bad).  It can't match SLR performance and does not pretend to.  Super zooms are a bundle of price/performance/bulk and weight compromises.  I could find no other camera that had a zoom with this range, with a lens this clean and fast, in a body this light, with a flash this effective, with such good battery life and with so many useful features, in a package this compact and at this price point.  Those features make me willing to put up with some of its fussiness.  It is what it is and I like it.  And I can tell from the recent upgrades that Panasonic is listening...UPDATE:  7-23-09  I have found a color that the camera's sensor can't quite reproduce accurately in auto.  Home Depot sold a New Guinea Impatiens flower this season (Vigoro brand line) in the color ""Crushed Grape""  This is a brilliant, glowing, luminescent grape color between violet and purple.  I have tried to photograph it in sun, shade and with the flash and the reproduction is always off.  Way off.  I did not tamper with color saturation to try and fix it since it did not look like a saturation issue.The included software is not working smoothly with my version of Windows XP and I can't figure out a way to burn photos to a cd.Still happy with my purchase.","01 20, 2009",A3JNT16SPU0D03,Keith H.,61.0,Very pleased with a few minor gripes...,22.0,507.0,1232409600.0,1262.0,16.7699179637,8.56514641394,8.20477154978,0.181510881708,0.0,0.8730852571

The image quality was fantastic with great high ISO performance and sharp images, even wide-open in the corners.  Other aspects of the camera bothered me though.  It didn't feel expensive - the front control ring was loose and felt cheap when I used it to change aperture, the flash frequently jammed even when I'd never pushed it down or interfered with its motorized action, the buttons felt cheap, the LCD developed stuck pixels quickly and had an uneven backlight.  This year, I felt I needed something new.  Thanks to the popularity of the S90, even on the used market, I was able to recover about half what I paid for it new.Enter the Fujifilm X10.BUILD QUALITY & SIZE:The best build quality I've seen in a compact, ever.  Speaking as someone who cares perhaps a bit too much about aesthetics, I'm in heaven.  Magnesium and aluminum everywhere.  The dials are tight and the zoom ring has a lovely heavy, fluid action.  It's simply a joy to use.  It destroys the PowerShot S90.  The viewfinder is bright and big for a compact but it's total lack of shooting information makes using it more of a novelty under all but the most predictable conditions.  Size-wise, the X10 is a bit smaller than expected.  Holding it was initially awkward with the neck strap lug attachment in the way of my right hand but I'm beginning to adjust to it.  More than anything, I'll miss the pocketability of the S90.  Even with its case I could slip it into my jeans pocket.  The X10, with it's protruding lens, will never fit in any of my pockets.  I'm awaiting the Fujifilm LC-X10 case to come down in price to sane levels before picking one up.IMAGE QUALITY:The first thing that struck me about the X10's images was the color.  Compared to the S90 and other compacts I've used, the colors are more realistic, more lifelike, less harsh and digital.  They resemble my Canon 30D DSLR's images more than anything.  Fujifilm cameras have long been known for their lifelike color reproduction and the X10 has it in full force.Dynamic range, even without using the EXR ""DR"" sensor-split expansion mode, is very good.  Using DR400 at 6 MP gives it almost an HDR quality, but more realistic.  Highlights are generally well-controlled although a phenomenon can occur at low ISOs with bright highlights like chrome: circular, hard-edged white orbs.  I've seen these on a handful of shots and once you see them, you can't ""unsee"" them.  I really hope Fujifilm can fix this with a firmware update.  My S90 never had this issue, in fact, I loved using it to take 15 second night shots at ISO 80.  Fujifilm has to address this.  In my opinion, its the biggest flaw of the camera.High ISOs are very good.  Things fell apart for my S90 above ISO 800.  The X10 holds strong up to and including ISO 3200.  More detail is retained and noise is finely-grained, not the jaundiced yellow blotches the S90 produced at ISO 1600 and 3200.  I'd like to use RAW but Adobe needs to update ACR to recognize X10 RAW files first.Resolution is good but not appreciably better than the 10MP S90, particularly at low ISOs.  The lens seems to be sharp in the corners, even wide open.  There is some barrel distortion at 28mm but nothing too bad.  The f/2-f/2.8 lens allows for much more depth-of-field control than what was possible with the S90.  Will it replace my 30D and 60mm f/2.8 lens for portraits?  Not quite, but it's darned good for a compact.My favorite ""special feature"" is the 360 Panorama mode.  It works surprisingly well.  The only caveat is the vertical resolution is an unimpressive 1080 pixels.Speaking of 1080 - the 1080p, 30 FPS video is pretty good.  Autofocus and zooming are present and accounted for, unlike the S90.  There is some of the dreaded CMOS ""jellyvision"" going on but only in certain circumstances.WRAP-UP:I'm sure you can tell that I really like this camera.  Canon lost me with the S100, which I was eagerly waiting for - too much of a priority on compactness and lens range at the expense of control and image quality.  Fujifilm built the X10 for photographers and its evident in how it looks, feels and operates.  One thing to think about is this:  Unlike Canon, Fujifilm doesn't have a low-end DSLR market to compete against.  They went all-out with the X10 since that price bracket is totally empty for them.  If you don't mind the relative bulk or price and you value a real ""photographer's camera"", the X10 is for you.***UPDATE***I tried to work around the ""white dot"" issue for months now.  Even after the firmware update that was promised to reduce the phenomenon, the issue remains and is as bad as it ever was.  It was very unethical for Fujifilm to roll out this update knowing it wouldn't resolve the issue, allowing the return window to expire as mine did.  Now I'm forced to unload this camera used at a loss.  Fujifilm will never have my business again.***UPDATE***In the end, Fujifilm pulled through and did the right thing.  I sent my X10 to the New Jersey service center and received a brand new replacement, entirely devoid of the ""white dot"" phenomenon.  This leaves me with an incredible compact that eventually led me to replacing my Canon DSLR with a Fujifilm X-Pro1.  While some of Fujifilm's products can be a little rough around the edges, it is clear that the company has a strong collective passion for innovation in the field of photography and especially sensor design.

The graphics are nice, but that's not enough. In the same way as Sony's PS4, Microsoft decided to remove many key features from this iteration of their next console (standard on the 360) without really any explanation.Pros* Controller sits in your hand nicely* Controller uses AA batteries which will give solid battery life* Tiles interface is similar to Xbox 360, works nicely (though a little dumbed down)* Snap App is amazingly awesome, can share videos on Skydrive (after rendering them)* Has CD player app* Has Netflix, Hulu, NFL, Skype* Ryse looks great at 720p* Forza looks great* HDMI pass through is an awesome new feature but... (see cons below)* Comes with Kinect (for that extra $100 kickup)* Blu-ray playerCons* Console gets very hot and it seems to have no fans* Controller trigger are too high up on the controller, should have extended further down* No audio on the controller* No touch pad on the controller* White lighted icon looks cool (on cont, xbox, kinect), for first 5 minutes then gets annoying really fast* Console is much bigger than Xbox 360* Tiles interface can make it difficult to find settings and other controls as they get lost* Kinect always-on camera is a creepy bit of privacy intrusion technology* Xbox One will not automatically log into accounts without using Kinect* Snap app doesn't support still snapshots (app is completely misnamed)* Has an insanely huge power brick* Kinect is klunky, heavy and huge* Cannot rip CDs to media library => instead requires network library to play media (or Xbox Music app)* Copying game disks to hard drive is not intuitive and is extremely slow* HDMI => have to leave the Xbox turned on and in TV mode to use it, doesn't work when the unit is off* HDMI lag is definitely noticeable when passing through PS4 or Computer* Cannot HDMI pass Xbox 360 as the 360 goes into 480p 4:3 mode, all others I've tested stay 1080p (can't MS test their own stuff?)* Limited launch titles* No Bluetooth (which means no keyboards, headsets or Bose Soundlink Minis)FeaturesFrankly, I expected a whole more out of this console than the PS4. While it does seem to deliver some new features like the HDMI pass through and a Blu-Ray player, Microsoft chained those features to some odd limitations, odd new choices and turned what should have been a gaming console into a Frankenstein-like device I dub the Frankenbox.  It tries to be too many things and fails at truly being any one of them truly well. Other than gaming, which is what Microsoft should have been solidly focused on, they created this Frankenbox. Microsoft tries to make up for the lack of games with other 'new features' like Snap or by touting Netflix, Crackle or Hulu (as if these weren't on every other TV device out there). For example, Snap tries to be the 'sharing system' similar to PS4, but does it so poorly. The PS4 does it so much better by offering live streaming to Twitch, uploading videos immediately and sharing stills to Twitter. Xbox One requires sharing videos to Skydrive (that no one uses) Worse, sharing a single video requires spending half an hour in a video app converting each video to a viewable formats and then uploading.  Such a waste of time.I realize this is Day One edition in every sense and much can be enhanced by software updates, but some of it cannot be (like heat dissipation).TV ModeWhen using the HDMI input connector to watch video from an external video device, you will find this part extremely buggy. You will find the whole Xbox will outright crash and reboot. Other times, it just shuts off. Sometimes it works perfectly, but because the HDMI pass through is actively processed by the Xbox One, there is a noticeable lag between the output from the other device and the display to your screen. This is not optimal if you're trying to pass in computer screen input. So, mouse movements are slightly off.To top it off, if you hook up the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One HDMI input, the Xbox 360 goes into forced 4:3 480p mode. So you can't even chain the Xbox 360 through the Xbox One. Though, amazingly, you can chain both the PS3 and the PS4 without video sizing issues. Though, the crashing remains constant.The UnitI was surprised to find how hot the XB1 runs. So hot, in fact, that when I touched it I was startled. To help combat the heat, I had originally bought a smallArctic Breeze USB fanto cool some external hard drives, I have since grabbed it and plugged it into the side USB port and it's now blowing across the top of the XB1  to cool it down. I don't understand why Microsoft didn't put fans in it. Considering the heat dissipation problems with the Xbox 360, I am most definitely concerned over the longevity of this unit. Also, I really don't need any more heaters in my room. If you plan on buying an XB1, here's some tips. Don't stack anything on top of it. Don't put it inside an enclosed cabinet. Make sure it has plenty of ventilation. For good measure, you might consider anArctic Breeze USB fan(or two) to help cool it down when playing games.The included Kinect is difficult to install. Yes, they put a tripod mounting hole on the bottom, but where are you supposed to use that?  I'm not sure what Microsoft was thinking here, but it's clear that the Microsoft engineers did not look at current TV flat panel designs to understand how to create a proper mounting bracket. There's just no place to properly secure the Kinect to today's flat panels.GamingWhile the games, so far, seem enticing graphics-wise, the gameplay is really subpar. For example, Ryse's environments are stunning, but the gameplay is average. Worse, in fact, than some games I've already played on the 360. So, while it's great we can slap a new pretty bow onto the games, the bow gets ripped off and tossed really fast. What's left (at least for Ryse) is the actual gameplay which, unfortunately, is below average. This is the same exact problem with Bioshock Infinite.  Eye candy all the way, but the underlying game mechanics were not in any way next gen ready.While the bad game mechanics issue is not technically a next gen console problem, you would think that someone would lay down some gaming laws to force developers to produce not only fabulous looking games, but games that actually have much more realism in the character mechanics, the motion capture animations and in the way the characters interact with the environments. Instead, we're left with a rail fighter using low def mocaps ultimately leaving Ryse far less realistic than it looks.OverallThis day one edition is definitely designed to be the Frankenbox of the console world. I also believe that the Xbox One is running a stripped down version of Windows 8. While Microsoft can easily send updates to improve on the tiled UI interface and features, the physical hardware limitations require a do-over (i.e., no Bluetooth). In fact, I'd expect a new version of the hardware to be available by spring to address the cooling and other missing features.  Ignoring the limited new features, this console is really a step backward from the Xbox 360 today. A lot of the features you came to know in the Xbox 360 have been stripped from this console. What has been added to replace those features are not enticing replacements. The Xbox One is basically bare bones basic.Don't jump into this console thinking you're going to get an Xbox 360 experience. You won't, likely not for many years. You'll be disappointed if you do. Considering it will not play Xbox 360 titles and has extremely limited title selections, I'd highly recommend waiting for Microsoft to improve the Xbox One (at least several months) and allow developers to release more games before jumping into this console.By all means, if you must have the latest greatest console just to see the graphics, then buy one. But, that's the only reason to buy one at this point or unless you really really have to play Forza or Ryse. You will be surprised by its lack of features, the bugginess of the TV feature, the 'big brother' privacy stealing Kinect and the heat. The Xbox One is definitely the future of Microsoft's gaming platform. What concerns me is not the long term viability of this console, but this specific edition of it. It's definitely early and it shows. $499 is a lot of money to spend to get a less experience to what can be had with an Xbox 360.I'd actually give this console 2.5 stars due to the above, but I'm rounding it to 3 stars.","11 24, 2013",A33Y35HJGDHZ2H,B.

There is still an issue with taking pictures in low light, and I'm talking about cloudy days, not in a darkened room. At times, I do have to move to Auto or my presets under P(rogram) mode. This takes away some of the creative aspects, but overall, I'm still quite pleased with the SX40.***Nov. 3, 2011 and Jan. 13, 2012 - [Please see posted photos here and noncommercial web site from my first days' and most recent shootings. A picture is worth a thousand words. Note that I purchase the camera only, not this package, but ultimately ended up with extra battery, and 16gb card. The card reader should be unnecessary.] I will do a complete review as the weather clears and I can take some photos in various light conditions. So far, it has performed well enough, but there is a learning curve from the SX20 which allowed greater latitude in overriding what the camera ""wants to do.""It may take a month before I can review the camera adequately, so I have uploaded some photos that I took on the first day, and I must say that they're pretty good. However, there were only 8 out of 51 taken. ...And then it started to rain. Please note that I am not new to the Canon line or (nature) photography: I have had the A620, S3, S5, SX10, SX20, and now the SX40. (I returned the SX30 which was a terrible disappointment.) And I've been taking pictures for over 60 years. So, unless you really get to know the camera - and even then - you may or may not get the results that I do.On that note, I might add that I was sorely disappointed that Canon didn't pop for a printed manual which, with this camera, is a must. Unlike the SX20 for which I could use the SX10 manual, this camera is quite different and - so far - I think more complex or at least more different than the SX20. Because of the issues that I've run into just in 3 days, it's very difficult to cross-reference what it says under Av with Tv or C1. This is not the basic point-and-shoot Elph, and I rarely shoot in ""Auto."" As I said, I have to give it a couple of weeks before I'll pass judgment.I must say that the photos that WERE already posted when I bought the camera gave me some trepidation in that so many were a little washed out. What I am finding so far is that, ""Auto"" might well be ""Average."" Average aperture, Average speed, Average contrast. But I purchased it anyway, and I've already found that Av or Tv or M are still the best settings although, unlike the SX20 where one could just set the speed and the camera would use the setting, I had to save the Tv settings to C1 or C2. This became routine by my third day (today).Nov. 8, 2011:Five days since I got the camera, and three days of shooting. I must say I've never seen so many comments regarding reviews, and many people have agreed with the more negative comments. What I've found is that the quality of photos I've taken have been excellent, needing very little post-production diddling. That said, and having used the burst mode, I'm deleting 4/5ths of the pix that I've taken, some because of duplication, some because of focus, and some because I just screwed up.In looking at the negative comments, I would admonish people to decide before buying this camera - or any other camera - WHAT DO YOU WANT TO USE THE CAMERA FOR??? I take pictures of nature, some scenery, but mostly birds, bugs, bunnies, bees, bears, and begonias. The SX40 HS has done very well in these areas, and I realize that there is a learning curve for such extreme focal lengths and the macro (which I rarely use).If you're going to take night time shots - which seems to have garnered so much comment about viewfinders and such - I can't address it. I took a picture of the (harvest) moon, hand-held, in Tv mode and it came out beautifully. But I don't take many nighttime pix, and I haven't had a chance to take fireworks in years. (If I want snapshots of people or parties, I use my wife's Elph.)I am still having some difficulty in overriding what the camera is set for re: aperture and speed. The SX20 could be overridden just by setting the speed to 1/2500th and one would get a much darker picture which could then be adjusted with software. Sometimes, it's the only way to get realistic clouds. With the SX40, I set it for 1/2500 and when I shoot, the camera comes down to 1/1600 or slower. IF I ever get the printed manual that Canon promised, I'll look for the menu where I can increase the value of the photo by -3 to +3. Yeah, I'm being a little lazy, but I hate the .pdf manual on disc that came with the camera.On the plus side, by coming down to 12 mp from 14 and by improving the processor, I can finally get SOME pix in low light or at least on a cloudy day. I've posted a few photos from the past few days: the two of the golden-crowned sparrows and the hummer were taken in low light and in thickets. They came out as sharp as anything I've ever taken with the SX10 or 20 (or S3 or S5 etc. etc.). Another plus, I am not having as much trouble with the SX40 focusing on a bird in the middle of a tree. The camera spots the center and at least HALF the time immediately seems to understand I want the bird not the branches.IF every photo I took came out perfectly, where's the fun in photography? Yes, sometimes the SX40 frustrates me, but Mother Nature sometimes frustrates me. Sometimes I think Mother Nature is picking on me. I ALWAYS though that Canon picked on everybody. After all, why do they come out with an improvement (?) every 10-12 months? Okay, the SX30 was terrible...I'll continue this in another week or so. For the time being, what I really like is the sharp photos I've been getting, and the 8 fps in the burst mode (the third is usually the best). I'm still not crazy about is the lack of an override for Tv and Av even using the C1, and I THINK the viewfinder is smaller than the SX20.Oh, btw, this camera is a few crucial (after a 5 hour hike) ounces less than the SX20. It's probably because it has a proprietary battery instead of the 4 AAs. I like the weight. What I don't like is that Canon wants $59 for a second battery, and has warned me about buying from ""the secondary market."" Comments? Suggestions? I'd appreciate knowing if there's a reliable battery that will work with this camera. (One of the other dealers offering a second battery as part of the SX40 HS package has been called out for offering a battery that doesn't fit the SX40!)I think it's silly to say that the LCD isn't as clear as a computer monitor. Never had one that was, and I'm often disappointed when something that looks in focus on the LCD is not nearly as sharp on my computer. After 12 years of digital photography, I've become accustomed to it. At least I didn't waste any film and have to wait two weeks to find out that my vacation pix are lousy.Still 4 stars for the features, 5 for the photos I've taken, and 3.5 for Canon engineers.Nov. 14, 2011.I posted more photos which speak for themselves. However, there is a caveat: I took 191 photos this morning mostly of deer, wild turkey, hawks, one praying mantis, and one tarantula. Of the 191, I posted (on my own site) 9. Here, I posted 5. And I kept 11. 180 were deleted, and that brings up two points. The burst mode of 8 fps works. That is, the SX40 really can shoot at 8 frames per second. However, not all will be in focus; many will be identical shots; and it is not the panacea for carefully composing and focusing and being at the right setting. (If you need the burst mode, you may be best off in Tv because speed is what you're after.)And please note: The battery is rated at being able to take 400 photos at the highest resolution and using the viewfinder (380 using the LCD). Well, if you shoot in the burst mode often or you take ""movies,"" expect your battery to go in about 250 shots - and that's fast at 8 fps. I have just purchased two more batteries and, though they're not Canon ""approved"" because they're 1/4th the price, I'm hoping that I now will never run out of batteries while shooting. Will report on that when I get them.Just one note re: the battery indicator. When the battery indicator is down from 3 (full) to 2 bars, it only takes 3-5 more photos to get it to show red and Charge the Battery. This isn't a lot more helpful than the old SX20 which allowed about 10 shots when it said to change the battery without any precursor. I was really looking forward to having a real battery indicator. This ain't it. Still 4.5 stars.Nov. 22, 2011I started this review on Nov. 3 by saying, ""So far so good,"" but I had a few reservations. I no longer have reservations, and would definitely recommend the SX40 to anyone who is more than a novice photographer. This is not a ""simple"" point and shoot, and you may get more than what you need or even want.It takes great photos, but you still have to know how to tweak its capabilities. If you're just going to keep this at ""Auto,"" then you don't need this camera. However, if you really want such features as taking movies and using ""my colors"" and a quasi-fisheye mode, this may very well be the camera for you. If you want to take pictures in RAW, this is not the camera for you (it doesn't have RAW). I care about none of these things, so for me the camera gets 4.5 stars. If you want those features, this camera may be only a 3 or 4.So basically, I'm content with my purchase. There's no second-guessing. No alternative would have made me happier. I REALLY like it, but I don't love it. BUT look at it this way: if I got perfect pictures every time, it would take all the fun out of digital photography. I still need room for creativity ... and improvement.","03 29, 2012",A36A1ZYZH8568P,"Ethan Winning ""Ethan Winning""",96.0,"Almost Great, But Not Quite. 4.5 Stars",11.0,632.0,1332979200.0,1905.0,19.0007362052,9.55038672236,9.45034948282,0.15844573217,0.0,0.873104491784

Just to start, I own a Samsung Captivate (Galaxy S1)phone and I have tried my friend's Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 a couple of times. Those are the only items I can compare on (I know they're not comparable to other tablets similar with the Tab Plus 7.0) but these are just a basis in case you own those devices.Screen:I am just basing this on what it looked like since I am a little bit lazy to research on the exact resolution of each screen. The screen on the Tab 7 Plus is somewhat similar in looks with the 10.1 but falls short when you're used to using a Super AMOLED screen (in my case, my Galaxy1 phone) I see the big difference every time I switch between the tab and my phone. SAMOLED screen is sharper and has very high contrast. But if you haven't owned a device with an amoled screen, you would give this tab's screen 5 stars because it's really good compared to other tablet screens i've seen in Bestbuy.GPS:Very spot on! (at least compared to my Captivate phone which had some issues before I installed a custom firmware on it) I have not tried navigation yet which I know should be the ultimate test on a gps but I walked about a mile with it and seems great to me. ""GPS status"" app from market locks up 12-14 satellites with SNR constant to about 40. But again, I haven't tried yet on how it deals with driving. I will have to give you an update on that..**UPDATE: 11/18. I tried driving for an hour upstate and back using Google Navigation (phone data is tethered to the tab plus, took about 5MB of map data in 2 hours). It's very accurate and responsive. It did not have any problems at all. :)Speed:Dual core SoC Exynos 1.2Ghz.. Very fast! Smooth scrolling and very fluid. One of the reasons why I didn't get the tab 10.1 is for some reason, its scrolling are not that smooth even if I try other launchers. But this tab plus 7.0 really makes the 10.1 look bad when it comes to simply scrolling. Launching apps is very fast as well. I haven't encountered any hiccup within an app. I have yet to try playing graphic intensive games. Will update again..Universal Remote? (Peel SmartRemote App):This is one of the reason why I got this tablet. There are limited tablets out there who has a built-in IR port for controlling Home theater systems. The app is pretty good but I don't think this can replace a Logitech Harmony remote right away since this software is pretty new. Their database for devices is somewhat limited for me. I own an old Samsung 46 inch LCD which the app can control. It can also control my Time Warner cable box and my Denon AVR 1911 receiver (ON/OFF/VOLUME/INPUT SOURCES only. doesn't support all buttons. I love the way Peel displays all the TV shows that are currently. You won't need to browse through the guide on your tv anymore. You can display based on genre (drama, comedy, action, sports etc) and you can even personalize your channels from there. Bottomline, the app is currently good on replacing you TV/Cable remote but is still limited in supporting other remotes. As for streaming players, it only has support for Apple TV and Roku for now. I submitted a request to Peel to support WDTV Live device, let's see how it turns out. By the way, search youtube for ""Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus Universal Remote"". Someone did an early post on what the universal remote app looks like.**UPDATE 1/17/2012: I ended up buying a Logitech Harmony 650 for only $49 (sold by Amazon and it's an excellent remote for the price!) because I gave up on the Peel app because the app development is very slow. At the very least, they do reply when you ask for support but I don't think this Smart Remote app is priority to them.WIFI:I get around the max 15Mbps limit on my Speed test app on this comparing to 5Mbps on my Captivate phone connected to 2.4GHz band. I tried the 5Ghz band and had same result for the Tab plus. I guess I have to try another app that would display more accurate results. My point is that it is fast. Browsing is very fast and very smooth. I watch HD trailers on the Movie Fone app and youtube without any hiccup.**UPDATE: 1/17/2012 - Speed definitely varies and has different factors like ISP, router, wifi chipset, CPU specs, OS etc. But I recently noticed that the wifi of this tab has the same performance as my desktop on quadcore proc, 12GB ram, dualband wifi, windows 7 64bit specs. Goes up to 30Mbps (Time Warner turbo boost)on my 15Mbps connection.Camera:Pretty good. 3MP back and 2MP front is enough to take decent pictures and videos. Did Skype a couple of times and they say my video quality on both cams is good. Oh and audio quality is superb and LOUD considering its size!Size and Weight:This is pretty much a perfect balance between a phone and a laptop for me. Fits in your pocket and it's big enough to browse and watch movies. It has a very premium feel. Build quality is awesome.Battery:So far so good. I've only had this for two days, charged a couple of times for a few minutes to an hour but I've only had it charged to 100% once. And battery performance is great!**UPDATE: 1/17/2012 - Battery has been superb for me lasts about 7-8 hours of almost nonstop use (surfing the web, youtube, music, skyping, streaming videos and downloading files. Battery drain is very little on standby so I won't worry if I don't use it for a couple of days.Overall:This is a great buy and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking great looks, performance and portability. For you guys who are used to having super AMOLED screens, you might want to wait for the Galaxy Tab 7.7 version but it will definitely come at a higher price. But I don't think it will be worth it if its price goes $100 higher than the Tab 7.0 Plus. I think I would prefer a 7 inch screen which is just right for one hand. We'll see when the 7.7 gets released.**UPDATE: 1/17/2012- Now that the price for this tab is only $350, I'd forget about the tab 7.7. I am 100% contented with this after almost 3 months of use. I've been using this without any problems at all and it always gives me the best performance regardless of how many apps i throw at it.

This was primarily the result of the new 3rd party games having a higher native resolution on the ps4 (for example &#8211; call of duty is a native 1080p 60fps resolution on the ps4 while it is a native 720p in the xbox one. Similar issue occurs with battlefield 4.). I personally enjoy 1st person shooters, which is a genre the xbox 360 was built around.  It helped that Bungie was releasing a 1st person shooter for the ps4 and xbox one (they created Halo). The included Kinect also pushed me towards a ps4. Here is my review of the ps4. Keep in mind this will probably be slightly biased (while not my intent) since it is coming from an Xbox owner who never previously owned a playstation console.Graphics -- Rating 8/10Graphics are an improvement over the xbox 360. It's not a day and night different like the previous generation jumps. It is a subtle upgrade in which you notice a little more detail. Right now you do have some dropped frames and some buggy scenes but it is not that bad. It is noticeable but it will not impact your game play. I expect these issues to clear up with game updates and with future releases as I believe it is all software related with nothing to do with the physical ps4 hardware. If you are looking to jump over to the next gaming generation for graphics, that would be a waste of money right now as the games (call of duty, killzone, etc) look pretty similar but with better lighting, effects, etc. The difference between the ps4's graphics and xbox one's graphics are nearly impossible to detect even with the 720p native (which is upscaled to 1080p) versus 1080p native resolution difference. Depending on the game, one system may look slightly better than the other. The most visually striking game I have seen thus far is xbox one's forza 5 (1080p 60fps native). The ps4's killzone looks nice as well but it does not quite have the detail. Overall, I expect the graphics on both the ps4 and xbox one to get better over time (hopefully with a 4k upconvert option)Performance - Rating 10/10The ps4 is a huge improvement over the previous generations. PS4 has an 8 core 1.6ghz processor with 8gbs of DDR 5 (the xbox one's processor is faster with 8 cores at 1.75ghz and the xbox one&#8217;s ram is faster as well after you combine the published ESRAM's specs and the 8 gb DDR3 ram's specs (just comparing what sony published and what Microsoft published).  The graphics card on the ps4 is roughly 50% more powerful than the xbox one's. The hard drives on both are the same, a disappointing 500gb 5400 RPM drive. From the performance reviews that I read, they take into account the operating system, hardware, etc, and are showing a stalemate between the two systems. The ps4 is faster in some aspects and the xbox one on others (reference websites such as Tom's hardware, etc.)  With that said, there is a massive improvement in performance over the xbox 360 (day and night). Everything opens up instantly without a delay. You can toggle between screens, go from a game to the home screen and then back instantly. Loading times are substantially quicker as well. It only takes a few seconds to turn the ps4 on and to play a movie in netflix, amazon (the xbox 360 took a few minutes). After getting use to the ps4&#8217;s raw power (or the xbox one&#8217;s), I do not like going back to the xbox 360.Controller - Rating 9/10The controller on the ps4 is amazing. I was not a fan of the old ps2 controllers and I was a huge fan of the xbox 360 controller. The ps4 controller is extremely light weight, very responsive and it feels very natural in your hands. I was worried about leaving the xbox 360's controller (which was the best gaming controller hands down) but this controller alleviated my concerns. The ps4 controller's touchpad is a very nice feature and easy to use. I've also used the xbox one controller and I would give it a slight advantage over the ps4 controller as I enjoy the triggers better which have a rumble pack in there and the resistance levels vary depending on the game. Overall, I would give the ps4 controller a 9/10 and rank it above the xbox 360 controller but behind the xbox one controller (which is the best controller I ever used -10/10 rating). Why the difference? While I personally enjoy the xbox one controller, I did NOT take a point off the ps4 for preferences. I viewed the touchpad versus the rumble button as a wash between the two. The difference is the ps4's poor battery life. Every 5 hours or so, I need to recharge the battery. I bought a 15 foot micro usb cable to compensate for the poor battery life (this may be a result of the blue light being constantly on). I enjoy having the ability to play the sound for the entire game, app (such as netflix) through the controller (headset connects into the controller). The xbox one does not do this. I would almost call it a draw on the controllers if it was not for the poor battery life.Software - Rating: 10/10The ps4 has a very simple and easy to navigate operation system interface. It is very responsive and intuitive. No complaints at all. I personally prefer the simple ps4 interface over the xbox 360s. I am not sure how to rank the xbox one in comparison. It is built around the kinect and gives a futuristic feel to it in comparison. If you enjoy the old school navigation using the controller, the ps4 interface is flawless (the ps4 camera is completely useless). If you want something to impress your neighbors and revolutionizes your interface experience, the xbox one would be nicer.  Overall, it is much simpler and faster to navigate through the ps4 in comparison to the xbox 360.Multimedia - Rating 5/10The ps4 cannot play files through the USB. It cannot play files on the network. It cannot play music CDs or 3D blu ray etc. The ps3 and the xbox 360 could do this without a problem. The bright side is that sony can release a fix in the future. I would like to be able to play mp4, mkv, divx, xsiv, mp3, wma, wmv, wav, etc files through usb or through the network. I do not understand why we are losing features going into the &#8220;next&#8221; generation. The xbox one cannot play these formats either (which his supposed to be the entertainment system). On the plus side, you have a lot of apps such as netflix, amazon, crackle and sony apps (that cost money). It does play blu-ray and DVDs after the day 1 online update.Online - Rating 5/10I am still trying to figure out what the $50/mo gives me. Microsoft has dedicated servers that cost the firm $1 billion dollars. This prevents lag, network manipulation and connectivity problems that occur when a user drops off that is a host. Microsoft has all the espn and nfl games broadcasted though xbox live for free in HD and they are developing their own tv series with HBO/Netflix budgets. They also give out two games a month. With Microsoft, I know where the $60/mo goes. The ps4 network has been down time to time. It took me 3+ weeks to be able to redeem the ps4 codes in the store (such as the ps plus 1 year membership that I bought). Sometimes it took 20 minutes to connect to the EA servers. When a host drops off the game, the game stops and it tries to find a new host for you (xbox one doesn't have this problem). Overall, the online service has been very poor. Fortunately, sony has been working on this issue and it has been improving. I hope they get dedicated servers in the future. The ps4 games from ps4 are rather poor thus far.Overall - Rating 7/10Overall, I think the xbox 360 currently gives a better overall experience. With that said, I see a lot more potential in the ps4. Most of ps4's shortcomings are a result of it being a new console with a limited amount of time on the market. Sony can easily fix these issues in the near future (within a year). Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase. I wanted a slightly different experience and I think ps4 offers that. With that said, I plan to buy an xbox one in a year (I currently use a buddy&#8217;s console) when the next halo comes out. Depending on sony's progress with the online experience, I will probably make the xbox one my primary console. If I could only have one system, I would pick the xbox one for its online game play, multimedia features and Kinect. Ps4 does not offer or do anything the xbox one cannot at this time (besides playing sony exclusives). The graphics and performance are the same on both so the advantage I thought the ps4 had did not really exist.  With that said, I have always been a two console guy (Nintendo and Microsoft) and I am looking forward to playing the Sony exclusives and seeing how they will advance their console over the next few years.","12 12, 2013",A2V0TX1N4A5DB,Jon Smith,86.0,In depth review from an xbox die hard.,20.0,576.0,1386806400.0,1634.0,93.2085335147,46.8960972584,46.3124362562,0.0323211037709,0.0,0.872456561325

I've also heard good things about Ipods...I like the size.  Not too big but not to small to see for my old eyes.  Fits in my pocket.I like the camera. Takes good pictures even in low light.  Good video.Nice screen!Now the bad:I did not like iOS.  I've heard it's great because it's so simple.  Too simple for me. I opened a movie in the video player but was in a bright room and needed the screen brightness turned up.  Exit movie. Open settings. Adjust brightness. Open movie.  Still not exactly right. Repeat.  Ugh, why not have a brightness adjustment in the player?  I even bought a player and download 3 more free versions and none did this. Just basic controls.  This is just an example of why I found it lacking. Not critical but suggestive of the overall poor design.I listen to lots of audiobook, podcasts, and instructional audio files.  Some are boring or just slow moving and I like to play them at 1.25x or 1.5x speed just to get through them.  The music player on the ipod has 1/2x, 1x, 2x. That's it.  Couldn't find a player on istore that could do this!You use the audo/video formats Apple commands you to use and nothing else.  I have been collecting video files for ages. I have a huge collection of DVD's that I've ripped and it wasn't too many years ago that .mp4 wasn't supported and .avi was it.  You can't play .avi on ipod.  You can't play .wmv or wma either.  You can find programs that will play them on the ipod (which just pisses me off since that means Apple has chose to say screw you we are't going to let you play them and we put extra work into making sure you can't).  But you can't use itunes to put them on the device you have to use a work around.  Also from what I played with the players can't access the stuff itunes put on the ipod so you have to switch back and forth, you can't just pick your favorite player.The camera takes great movies but the aspect is wierd.  If you hold the phone in portrait mode you get a tall skinny video that looks really stupid played on anything but the ipod.  Since they are in .mov format I like to convert them to .mp4 so I can watch them on all my equipment.  Not everything I have is cutting edge and plays .mov files.  But most converters see the strange aspect ratio and flip the video 90 degrees.  I've found a program that will flip it back but you still end up with a tall skinny video.  It fits the tall skinny ipod fine but say a widescreen tv is the exact OPPOSITE so when you watch it on a 42&#34; you only use like 25% of the screen.The Apple Community.  I belong to hundreds of forums.  It's hard not to these days since if you have a question about some product you have to join their forum to ask a question.  I've asked several questions on the official apple forums, and in several other FAN forums.  No answers in weeks.  Usually someone posts something in reply.  Most posts I did read had replies that basically amounted to - sorry you can't do that / no one knows how to do that / read the manual you moron / there's no way to do what you want / look at this; it's not an answer but it has some of the same words so we'll waste your time sending you there.Itunes. You have to install itunes and use it if you want to get something from you computer to the ipod. I use XP. I HATE itunes.  It's a resource hog, takes forever to load (on my pc - guess apple expect me to buy a new computer just to use their ipod) is just plain cumbersome to use.  I just want to open my file explorer, click on my files and drag them to the device.  I can load 1000 songs on my mp3 player before I can even start itunes.  Stupid stupid stupid.  It's another example of Apple saying our way or the highway.Sorry, I did not have this attitude with apple until I bought this ipod.  Actually, I figured ok apple does things one way so they must have perfected it. No.  There doesn't seem to be any incentive for them to respond to the public; I mean you either use what they give you if you want an ipod or you don't get one.There's more good and bad but the bad has outweighed the good for me and I just returned my ipod.  I bought a samsung galaxy gt-I9000 phone just to use as a media player.  I'm sure I'll have issues with it too...  I realize some of my issues with the ipod are most likely due to ignorance of iOS which is why I asked questions.  But without answers the issues remain.If you are an apple fanperson then this review is useless to you.  Don't argue with it since we both have our opinions.  Maybe if I had prior experience in the past with ipods it would be different but I don't. New or different doesn't mean better for everyone.

We had all hoped, at least in professional circles, that the new version would eclipse the old in every respect. Sadly, this is not the case. The new lens is optically superior over the same focal lengths, but this new lens exhibits the strongest focal breathing effect ever seen in a pro lens of this type. No other 70-200 or 80-200 will be stunted in reach as this new one is. It's quite unique in that respect and this issue will be a deal breaker for some event, wedding and portrait shooters. It is not a small issue and it cannot be corrected. Stranger still is the voices of several prominent online reviewers who seem bent on masking or underplaying this significance of a 70-200mm zoom that falls 72mm short at close focus. It's hard for many of us to believe that they are not protecting a relationship with Nikon. Typically, when shooting a wedding, we found that the new lens was too short and images required cropping. At a children's party the same issue presented itself. At 10 feet away it was not possible to frame a face as the original lens could do. And yet this lens is absolutely state of the art in every other respect. Likely, this will be one of Nikon's most debated lenses, though those who shoot over typically longer distances will find this lens ideal. Still, Nikon has a clear error on their website. They claim that the 70-200 maintains it's full zoom range at minimum focus. And it most certainly does not. Any honest shooter should not debate this issue. It WILL effect some professional applications.So let's have a look at this beauty!Handling:The new lens is actually quite close to the size and weight of the original. I've put it on a D700, D3 and D90. I find it balances well on the D700 with grip as with the D3. On the D90 it's poorly balanced. Just for kicks I also put on my baby D40, which had almost absurd handling, but one could get used to it. The loss of the focus lock button was not missed by me. This is a heavy lens and it can tire a person out over the hours on a job.Build Quality:Well, I think we all knew what to expect and got it. I'm not sure that the 70-200 is built better than the old version, but it might be. It's 100% top notch.Sonics:The new lens focuses as quietly as my old lens, but the VR noise is cut by half or more. In fact you have to strain to hear it. Nice little improvement!Sharpness:Thus far I find sharpness exceeds all of my other lenses and that includes a new Tamron 180. Previously I found the Tamron 90 and 180 sharper than the Nikon 200, 24-70, 105 vr, 28-70 2.8 and so on. But the new zoom is so stunningly sharp wide open, that it's truly a marvel.This shot, wide open at 2.8 and set for 200mm, proves what kind of performance is to be expected...[...].Color, Contrast and Bokeh RenditionIt's difficult to say if the new lens exceeds the original for color, but the obvious improvement in contrast certainly helps. The nano coating is doing it's job and the results, even around strong stray light sources appear to be universally superb. Bokeh is also what we'd expect. At the same apparent focal lengths it's on par with the original lens, but the micro-contrast makes images pop more and that may lead some to think bokeh is improved.Zoom RangeThis is probably going to effect many people more than any other single aspect of the design. This lens exhibits severe magnification loss which may significantly effect your work, especially at distances below 15 feet. This has been discussed and outlined (at last), but to put it in a nutshell....at about 4.6 feet away you'll be at 128mm, which is a loss of 36%. While every other zoom of this range and caliber exhibit this effect, none have ever lost so much. This is unique to the 70-200 II and it will effect wedding & event shooters, not to mention photojournalists. It's significant enough that Nikon is seeing lenses returned. My source for that info is a Nikon rep and a saleperson at B&H; photo. While some people are compelled to debate this issue, you simply need to say ""135mm at 10 feet away is NOT the same as 190mm at 10 feet away."" If you can say that and understand BASIC photography, then you already know that even 10mm makes a huge difference for some types of shooting. Sadly, we're looking at a LOT more than 10mm loss here.Here is a series of shots taken at a party:[...].While the shots are passable, some also required heavy crops at distances where the original 70-200 would have required little to none. My usage of the lens on a job led me to a simple conclusion: The loss of magnification is a problem. But the lens is so good at close range at it's typical focal lengths that it's still worth keeping. Using with DX or with a TC are also viable options. I've seen one informal test showing that the 70-200 II with a TC 1.4 is still sharper than the older version and that's with both set for F4. That's amazing!Still, people who enjoyed using this lens for heavy portrait work may be unhappy. The lens was known for it's flexibility in that regard and it's clear that some of that is lost. A major online reviewer actually dared to suggest that 135mm at 6 feet was ""good enough because that's a classic portrait focal length.""Can you imagine anyone saying such a thing? With the original version of this lens, 185mm was a pretty classic focal length too! It's amazing what depths people will plumb to protect their interests.FocusI don't know exactly how or why, but my focus hit score yesterday was nearly 100%, which is on par with my 24-70. I was always closer to 90% with the old 70-200. So I'm going to say, rather offhandedly, that this lens has better AF. If so....it's a BIG deal!VR IINo huge surprise here. You can, with some good technique, hold this puppy down for sharp shots below 1/10. I could do that with the original but worked a LOT harder to make it work.Value:Well, you can kick yourself in the head every day and say it's fun, but a lot of people will call you crazy. The new version costs 2400.00 US and that's nearly 800 more than I paid for the VR I. But most people think the old one's price was insane, so why worry. High end lenses cost a lot of money. I paid 3K for my speakers and a lot of people would call that nutty as well. Tomorrow I'll do a job using the new lens that will easily pay for it, so for a professional it's much less of a question. Do we get 500 dollars worth of improvements? Heck no, not with the loss of FL! Is the new lens worth having? Heck yes, especially with the better IQ and VR! If I was a hobbyist shooter I'd probably stick with my old version and be happy.Summary:The 70-200 VR II is a bit perplexing. It's IQ is really beyond most expectations. My copy shows sharpness that exceeds a stopped down 85 1.8 and my macro primes as well. But a good deal of people will be troubled by the loss of apparent FL at closer range. One fellow on another forum has already explained clearly why this hurts wedding work or even shooting someone standing at a podium from 12 feet away. If you typically used the previous version at closer distances, you'll either adapt or be unhappy. Adding a TC helps, but now we have a 2800 dollar lens! So if someone wanted a pro zoom for event work and they wanted to do a LOT of ultra tight portrait shots, this would probably not be a top choice anymore. In the end the ultimate value of this lens is somewhat diminished by the obvious advantages at MFD of the original. Yet we do get stellar state of the art IQ that's hard to pass up, even at 128mm MFD. My choice is simple. I've decided to keep mine and use a TC 1.4 or 1.7 and also learn to use it on DX more often if the situation demands it. It's not as sleek a solution as I hoped, but the resulting images should be better overall. I rate the lens at 4 stars. For it to hit 5 stars it would have come close or matched the MFD ability of the original. You simply can't ignore how good the original was in that respect and I'm disturbed by seemingly intelligent shooters out there who are content to present misinformation on this point. One of the most famous online reviewers actually said that the new 70-200 VR II exceeds the performance of the original in every way. Of course that's patently impossible when the new version can't even come close to the near focus focal range of the original. Whatever fuels this ""Protect Nikon"" position, it does only harm to the photographic community.I'm hoping that mainstream reviewers present honest detailed reviews that pull no punches with a lens that is unique against every other 70-200 and 80-200 on the market when it comes to losing magnification at less than infinity. A reviewer should respect the full scope of applications for a pro lens, report on a products strengths and weaknesses and leave his own agenda at the door.So: The new 70-200 VR II is going to be a fantastic upgrade for some shooters and a serious letdown for others. For me it falls somewhere in the middle. Based on your individual style and job requirements, YOU must make your own ultimate judgment.It's a crying shame that Nikon failed to maintain the reach factor at close focus as in the original 70-200. If they had, then this would be among the greatest lenses ever designed. Failing that I rate as basically equal overall to the original version. which is really better for some types of shooting.","01 22, 2010",AJ62SC0HYEKU,Capt RB,92.0,"Great Lens, but BEWARE",100.0,653.0,1264118400.0,1840.0,14.3080507681,7.02580829996,7.28224246814,0.207211060493,0.0,0.873102263905

I commuted to work with a camera backpack containing my body, some lenses, my laptop and other stuff. Then I had one kid... and two kids... and three kids... and carrying around a DSLR, even just the body and one lens, got to be a huge hassle. So I turned to point-and-shoot cameras. I used a PowerShot S90 as my primary camera for quite some time, but I was never satisfied with the fact that I couldn't get the same kind of image quality out of my PowerShot as I was able to get from my DSLR.I needed to find something that had the image quality of a DSLR and the portability of a point-n-shoot. Of course, there is no such thing. But the X100 is as close as it gets. I carry this camera with me everywhere, all the time, in the outside pocket of my ""man purse"". And the image quality coming out of this camera... well, I think it's stunning. I love the color, contrast and sharpness this camera can produce. Its lens flares are lovely, its bokeh is sublime. There is something about this camera's output that is really unique. I think my infatuation with the X100 began the minute I saw sample photos.But this is not an easy camera to use. Unfortunately it is highly idiosyncratic and a little buggy. It took me a few weeks to understand all the little rituals I had to go through to use it properly: Don't forget to take it out of macro mode before putting the lens cap on. Remember to compensate for the macro focus-shift bug by moving backwards ever so slightly after autofocus lock. Use manual focus with the auto-focus override to take a series of macro photos without waiting for the unbelievably slow macro autofocus. The list goes on.But once you learn how to get the most out of this camera it becomes a very powerful photographic tool. I have taken stunning low-light long-exposure photos. Awesome snaps of the kids. Long exposures in very bright light (the ND filter rocks). Incredible action shots taken at very fast shutter speeds. Pictures of unbelievable sharpness and detail. This list goes on, too.Something else about this camera is the fact that it's a pure joy to hold and operate. The build quality and feel are off the charts. Everything is solid and precise. It looks and feels like you're holding a vintage Leica. People are drawn to it. Many think you are indeed holding a vintage Leica. It's simply beautiful.The unique hybrid viewfinder on this camera is also something special. I don't tend to use it in OVF (optical viewfinder) mode that often, but I can see how it would be perfect for landscape photography and the like. Personally I use it in EVF (electronic viewfinder) mode. I like this mode because it saves battery, reduces glare, shows me exactly what I am framing, and allows me to point the lens at very bright things (i.e. the sun) without hurting my eyes.I should mention this is a great camera for street photography. Use zone focusing, carry it about, no one cares at all. It's unobtrusive, and perfect for capturing life as it happens.Battery life is very good. It's almost as good as the battery life on my PowerShot S90, and that's saying something. It's far better than the battery life of any DSLR I'm aware of.So, why shouldn't you get this camera? Well, there are four primary reasons:The first is that this camera has a terrible focusing system. It's almost inexcusable. The autofocus is very, very slow. And the manual focus-by-wire is also very, very slow. Learning how to combine manual focus with autofocus for faster picture taking is one of the hurdles to using this camera. I take a lot of kid pictures, and this camera struggles to keep up with them. It can be hard getting the shot I want, and I have been frustrated more than once because I missed something even the cheapest DSLR would have gotten.The second reason you might not want this camera is the fixed lens. I hope you like the focal length because you don't get to change it.Next, the weird threading on the lens makes attaching normal accessories like filters and hoods a bit of a pain, and the Fujifilm accessories for this camera are astronomically expensive and hard to find.Finally, you might not want this camera if you are not willing to invest the time necessary to learn how to use it properly. It is not user friendly. It's buggy. You have to learn how to work with it, and around it. For some people this is a huge barrier to entry, and I personally don't blame them. I think Fujifilm dropped the ball here.But, all that said, if you are fine with the cost and the bugs and the learning curve and the fixed lens and everything else, what you are left with is a camera that is utterly joyful to shoot with. Carrying this camera around just feels right. It's simply pleasurable. And the photos you get can be of astounding quality.So what you are considering here may not be a purchase so much as a relationship. The X100 and I are pretty happy together. ;-)","10 14, 2011",A3SWLDY5FWIDNL,Eric C.

These were my 'dream' headphone since the beginning of my audiophile journey. One I never thought I'd ever buy back then. It's also one of the few headphones that after I learned what sonic quality I wanted in a headphone, didn't think I would personally like. If I had bought them months or years ago, I'm not sure I would've liked them. I tend to prefer a bright, aggressive, bass and treble-centric headphone. The HD650 is known to be the opposite. Dark/warm, relaxed, and smooth, with dulled treble response. You can see why I was very adamant about not ever giving these a chance.It wasn't until recently that I wanted to venture out and look for something a little different from my normal preferences. An alternative that I'd use whenever I wanted to sit back, and enjoy a soothing sound, with forward mids/vocals that I could watch my TV shows, movies, anime with. Ironically, my secondary can is considerably more expensive than my main can (DT990s) at the time. Lol, Head-fi logic. Well, I went and took the plunge, hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. I thought I would hate them. Really. It was an experiment that would cost me, but one I needed to do at some point, as the HD650 was always that ONE headphone I was always curious about (more than any other).So what happened? Did I like them? Hate them? To my surprise... I loved them for music, movies, TV, and anime, and liked but wasn't thrilled by them for gaming. Let's get into the sound.Bass: The lows. Well, this is surprising. They are actually pretty bassy. Not DT990 bassy, but they have a nice, full, bassy sound. I'd say it's between the DT880 and 990 in presence. It's a warm bass, with medium speed. Pretty much ideal for all-rounder headphones with good bass that would please those that like balance and a fun signature. The bass quantity is enjoyable for all crowds, unless you're a pure neutral-head or pure bass-head. I didn't find myself wanting more bass, though they do roll off in the sub-bass, which is typical of most dynamic headphones, something the HE-400 has no problems with.If I could score the bass, it'd be; Quantity: 7.5, Quality: 8. Just really pleasing bass all around.Mids: This is the star of the show. And when I say star... I mean, it is absolutely one of the best interpretation of mids/vocals I have EVER heard on any headphone...EVER. I'm usually fine with mid recession as I tend to prefer bass and treble emphasis, but MAN... once I heard the HD650... it made me see mids in a whole new light. The vocals are so sweet, so upfront, so rich, so haunting! Based on mids alone, I recommend this headphone to ANYONE looking for a headphone that does vocals some amazing justice. The only other headphone that provides really sweet mids that I've heard is the Audio Technica ESW9, but the ESW9 is a closed on ear, with a considerably smaller soundstage, and overly smooth treble, and stuffy sound signature in comparison. The ESW9 is good, but not HD650 good.The HD598 also has very forward mids, but I felt the lean bass, and thinner sound, made the mids sound unnaturally forward and shouty. The warmth and fullness of the HD650 basically destroyed any chance the HD598 had in a direct comparison. There was no competition. The HD650's mids demolish the HD598's in tone, realism, and richness. The HE400 is often compared to the HD650, and despite my preference for the HE400, the HD650 is clearly the king of mids here. The HE400 has great, INTEGRATED mids, that don't sound pushed back or forward with a realistic tone. That being said, the HD650's forward mids are special. The HD650 clearly wins here. As far as Q701 and HD650's mids, the HD650 wins again. The Q701 has forward mids, but they aren't nearly as full sounding, or as rich.Long story shot, the mids are godly. If I had to score them: Quantity: 10, Quality: 10. That is perfection, because that's how I feel about the HD650's mids.Treble: Oh the treble. This is single-handedly the ONLY reason I have put off getting the HD650 for so long. If you read about the HD650, the treble will always be discussed and debated on. Are they too smooth, rolled off, undetailed... veiled? This is a debate that will never end on Head-fi. As a fan of treble sparkle and some emphasis, I was absolutely mortified about hearing what people said of the HD650's smooth, laid back, dull, treble.So how did they sound to me? Surprisingly, I REALLY liked the treble! I didn't LOVE it. I still do prefer some more sparkle, but as the relaxing alternative to my typical treble emphasized headphones, I didn't find the treble overly smooth or dull on the HD650. Trust me, when your main can is the DT990 which is known for it's SUPER treble emphasis, and compare it directly to the much more reserved and rolled off treble of the HD650, you would tend to notice a huge difference. In all honestly, I really thought the treble on the HD650s was right where it should be for the type of headphone that the HD650 is. Without that treble, I think the HD650 wouldn't sound as rich and 'creamy' as they do. Would I use the HD650s as my ONLY headphone? To be frank, no. They performed well in absolutely everything except genres that desired an aggressive signature. Stuff like metal, and EDM just didn't have the energy on the HD650s. So no, they aren't the perfect all rounders. However, through some vocal dependent tracks, and stuff like movies, TV, and most non-music needs (even gaming), the HD650s are indeed in a very good place. Unfortunately, I tend to listen to EDM and metal more than anything, so the HD650 lost a few points.To score the treble; Quality: 7, Quantity: 7. If the treble is boosted by a bit, these could be what I'd consider very natural to neutral with a slight emphasis towards bass. I think they'd be less rich overall though, so I personally wouldn't want to touch what makes the HD650 what they are.Amping: I have the HD650 paired up with the Audio-GD SA-31 which is much more powerful than pretty much any amp most of you use, or would use, so I'm not exactly sure how they'd sound with less power, but I personally felt that they aren't as hard to drive as people make them out to be. They need considerably less power than the DT990/600, and possibly even the DT990/250. I'd say they'd need about as much as the DT990/32 for at LEAST volume level. We know power =/= volume, but it helps. To be clear: they do not need a lot to be driven LOUDLY. I tested them with the Mixamp only, and they can be driven off it loud enough. I didn't test it enough to see how well they're actually driven, but they sounded good. They may be a little thinner sounding, which could actually be a good thing for gaming, as it makes pinpointing sounds a bit easier than the very rich, thick signature the HD650s have with the SA-31.Okay, so how did they perform for gaming?---START GAMER SECTION---Soundstage: I haven't gotten to the specifics of gaming with the HD650s yet, but I'll mention the soundstage first. With and without extra amping the Mixamp, I felt the HD650's soundstage to be medium sized. Not big, and not little. However, I didn't find them to be stellar in terms of depth, so the sense of space for gaming, wasn't as good as I would have hoped. I was always expecting the HD650 to not be the greatest pairing for Dolby Headphone, and my fears were slightly warranted. The front/back depth isn't great. Let's get that out of the way. The width is good, but not close to being the best. The DT990 destroys the HD650 in both depth and width. So how's the air within the soundstage? Well, the problem with the HD650, is that it's a very full sounding headphone. Thick, warm tone tends to make the soundstage seems less airy and smaller. This is one of those times where a thinner/leaner sounding headphone has the advantage, like the AD700/HD598/K701. The HD650 isn't STUFFY like say the ESW9, but that rich tonality doesn't help gamers.Positioning: Positioning and soundstage tend to go hand in hand, so if the soundstage isn't great, the positional cues will suffer. How did the HD650 fare positional-wise? Well, they were good. Not great, and could obviously be better, but they do their job. I could play something like Black Ops without any problems, though having used headphones much better for soundstage/positioning, I could tell they lacked a bit. I'd put the HD650 just ever so slightly above the DT880 positional wise, but they aren't that much better.Clarity: You need clarity for soundwhoring in competitive gaming. Despite the laid back treble, I found the natural tone of the HD650 to be very detailed. The forward mids came off very clean and clear, and I felt I didn't miss any sounds. I've heard better overall (even the 990's are better for soundwhoring). The problem is that the HD650 is a very thick sounding headphone. Basically, the issues I explained in the soundstage section is what hurts clarity for gaming purposes.---END GAMER SECTION---Comfort: I mentioned that Sennheiser likes their clamp. The HD201, HD280 Pro (!), PC360, and HD598 all have some form of clamp. The HD650 is no different. They do clamp a bit more than I'd personally like, but it's a minor gripe overall. I find the HD650 to be very comfortable overall, and over extending the arms a little, to wear the HD650 slightly loose alleviates the clamp a bit. I've felt better, but not much better. The velours are great. Not too firm, and not too soft. The cups are huge and will fit ears very comfortably. I like the oval shape, which makes them easier to use while laying down compared to circular cups.Value: The Sennheiser HD650 is a considerably expensive headphone. If your main purpose for getting a headphone is gaming, there are considerably better options for less. If pure audio fidelity, and non-gaming purposes is your main purpose, the HD650 is incredibly hard to beat. Their sound signature is just stellar for most things, save for a few genres, and they're competent for gaming, just not stellar. I personally can't justify owning both the HD650 and HE-400, so I stuck with the HE-400 which is a more energetic, and better equipped for gaming use.Final Impressions: The HD650 has a very special place in my heart. It took years to finally take the plunge, but I'm VERY glad I did. They have quickly become one of my very favorite headphones. Though their gaming performance isn't as stellar as I would have hoped, it's better than I expected. I absolutely love the HD650 overall, and they have made me see the importance of mids, if even for just non-gaming, non-music use. Movies and TV shows are made for the HD650. Their incredible tonality, rich/full sound, perfect mids are an absolute blessing. Treble is definitely it's weakest aspect of sound, but they aren't veiled, just...reserved.For gamers looking for all-rounders, these do put up a fight. They're better than the vast majority of headphones I mentioned on this guide in terms of audio fidelity, but in raw performance for gaming, they're outclassed by others costing considerably less.","06 17, 2013",A21EXYTX5JWPAU,Christian G.

I originally bought this because I misplaced my shuffle and like to listen to lectures from class as I do chores.  I wanted to have more control to skip, rewind etc than the shuffle provided and this was cheaper anyways.  I was pleasantly surprised with all the extras the player is jam-packed with.  I am a student and better with computers than some older folks but am no technophile.WHY IS THIS THE BEST PLAYER? (in order of importance to me when I was buying)1) Easy file transfer: No itunes needed!  I had itunes because it seems doubly redundant: I've gotta get the file on my computer, then copy it to itunes, then move it on itunes from my music to my ipod.  I find this very irritating.  With the Sansa Clip, you link the player to your computer and it opens like a thumb drive: just click and drag the file onto the player.  There are pre-arranged folders you can drag the mp3 into: Audiobooks, Playlists, Record, Music, Podcasts, Service.  You can still use a media manager like Windows Media Player or itunes to sync if you want to, but you don't need to!2) Product Brand: Sansa is the mp3 player created by Sandisc which most of you will recognize as the memorycards you use in your camera.  This is a company that has been around for awhile which has a history of creating good quality products.  They are not a ""flashy"" company like ipod, but that just means they are spending their money of R&D; and not advertising campaigns.3) Pretty colors: The 4GB player comes in a lovely array of colors, including my favorite shade of purple.  I really only needed the 2GB player, but upgraded one size to get my favorite color.  :-)  The 2GB and 8GB models currently just come in black.4) Price: circa 2GB=$30, 4GB=$40, 8GB=$52.  ALOT more bang for your buck.5) Size & weight: 2"" x 1"" x 1/4""  Easy to use clip which I clip to my bra.  I can forget it is there, then plug in whenever I want to use it.  The player is plastic which means it is lightweight and durable (no glass screen!)6) Good sound quality.  I'm not an expert, but the quality sounds great to me.  There are two basic volume options you can choose from the menu (normal, high).  Then you use the +/- volume control on the side of the player for smaller adjustments.  I think this is done to increase the spectrum of volume you can listen to.7) Microsd slot and slotradio cards: I did not buy it for this reason, but enjoy this greatly.  If you are a fan of Pandora, you will love slotradio.  These are tiny memory cards each costing ~$30 which come in a variety of music types with 7-8 preset playlists.  Each card contains 1000 songs (yes 1000!).  A song can appear on more than one playlist.  The playlists are great; each slotradio usually includes a workout and a chill playlist with the rest being more specific to the type of music on that chip.  Why so cheap?  slotradio avoids copyright issues the way that Pandora does: You don't have control of the order of songs played and cannot replay a song.  However you can skip forward as often as you like (which you can't do in Pandora) and there are no adds either.  You also do not own the mp3; you can't download a song file from the chip to your computer.  I love it because I don't have to buy, upload, and organize songs.8) FM radio!  It is easy to create presets and then skip from radio station to radio station.9) Recorder.  The black outer rim of the player is a microphone which can be used for dictation.  Easy to record.  When you press stop, the file is automatically saved as an mp3 file which you can delete on the player or copy onto your computer.  Just an added bonus.10) Auto transfer of other file formats to mp3.  I had a bunch of files I wanted to listed to but were in wpa or something format that I couldn't put on my ipod.  I dragged the file onto the player and was asked if I wanted to store the file or listen to it?  I selected listen and the file was automatically converted into an mp3 that I could listen to or drag back onto my computer.  MAGIC!HOW THE SANSA+ COULD BE IMPROVED (for me at least).  Other than the first two, these are picky points.A) Annoying on/off switch: a button similar to that on a computer as opposed to an instantaneous slide on/off like on the ipod.  It takes a few seconds to turn on and load; just long enough to be moderately annoying.  I think it is set to turn off at 5 min, which I changed to 15 min so I could easily pause, unpause whatever I was listening to without having to wait a few secs for the player to turn on.  You can change the setting for length of time for the screen to darken and for the player to turn off.B)  Battery life is ~8 hrs to play music files, ~4 hrs if playing from the slotradio chip (obviously dependent on how often you use the screen).  You will have to recharge the player every day or so if you use it every day.  In comparison, I could go weeks without needing to charge my shuffle.  For someone sitting in front of a computer every day, this isn't a big problem, but if you are going to be traveling somewhere without access to a computer to recharge or overseas, this might become an issue.  Fortunately it doesn't take to long to charge completely.  However it is a convoluted process to figure out how much batter life is left.  There is a bar at the top of the screen, but to get exact % left, you have to go Settings> System Settings> Info> Power.  This is not explained in the manual and I had to hunt to find it.C) Style: the design is a little boxy looking.  Even though my player is purple, only the top plastic is colored- the edges and back are black.  I would rather have function over cuteness though and I bet future generations will be more attractive.  I imagine it also decreases cost to have all players have the same colored base.D) No case (although no mp3 I know of has one which will store the earbuds, charging cord etc).  I need to be able to throw everything into my jumbled bacpack without getting cord snarls, etc.  Not a big deal though: I bought a $2 chinese jewelry purse to keep my player, earbuds, charger, and slotradio cards safe which works great.  I would love someone to come up with retractable earbuds.E) Because I listen to a lot of 50 min lecture files it would be great to have a player that remembers where each lecture is paused so I can skip around different lectures without losing my place in each one.  The Sansa remembers the pause location of only the last file you listened.  This is advantageous for listening to music (be bad to come halfway into each song), but annoying for listening to longer lecture files.","05 1, 2011",A29PPUG17KE809,Abby,61.0,Best little gem available!,15.0,524.0,1304208000.0,1277.0,22.191887716,11.0964406112,11.0954471048,0.135188568914,0.0,0.872851277858

Since I really don't want to be bothered with having to change lenses all the time, the super-zooms are attractive, and since I have been in love with my little Panasonic ZS5 for the past 3-4 years, I was hoping the Panasonic super-zoom would be an easy transition. I was not mistaken.After two weeks of using the FZ200 and taking about 1000 photos, I can confirm that it is a superior camera. This camera is FAST - you should see the photos of the PSU women's basketball games I have taken. And the F2.8 widest aperature applies throughout the huge zoom range - a super-zoom first. The colors are fantastically realistic - you should see the Happy Valley sunsets and sunrises I have taken. The focus is nearly instantaneous and precise - you should see some of the macros I have taken. The manual focus is easy to use and spot on - you should see some of the difficult close-ups over water and ice I have taken (it's hard for AF to focus with an ice background). The stabilization is the best I have ever seen - you should see some of the maximum zoom hand-held photos I have taken.It is light. It comes with a lens hood. The front of the lens if threaded so it will take filters and super macro add-ons. It allows you to store 4 custom settings. It had HDR. It feels solid and fits nicely into the hand. It has a 3"" articulated, high resolution LCD. It has a large, high resolution view finder. It has 3 programmable function buttons. The battery seems to last forever. It has so many ways to correct or edit photos that you will be learning how each of these things works for years to come. It is quiet. It looks professional.As you can see, I could go on and on...and I'm not a Panasonic or Amazon employee.Now a few drawbacks; after all, nothings perfect.I'm replacing the FZ200 I got with a new one because when I make a lot of setting changes quickly it gets overloaded, locks up, and needs to be restarted - not a huge problem but irritating sometimes. As a previous reviewer said, it is strange that Panasonic didn't put a more detailed Quick Menu on this camera like the ZS5 has. Perhaps that's because a lot of those functions are located in buttons on the camera body. It takes a little effort to remember that you set the AF,Macro, and Manual focus on the lens barrel instead of in the software - different from little point & shoots. So far I have not found a case like they used to make for the old film SLRs. I'd rather have a case instead of a ""bag"" as advertised on the webpage. And...if you're coming from a small P&S;, it's an adjustment to learn where all the controls are on the camera body.But it's worth it. This is a superior camera and Panasonic has set a very high bar in the super-zoom arena.EnjoyDecember 22-26, 2012 update:Yes, I will upload some photos after Christmas sometime. Here's what I have learned after at least another thousand photos:1. I continue to really like the camera. The 2.8 lens is terrific and this camera is VERY FAST - both the lens and the electronics.2. The electronic manual focus is tricky and takes some patience and practice. I think I would prefer a manual focus ring, but I guess I can't have it all.3. I still think the quick menu is helpful but hard to use. It improves with practice, but is not as good as the quick menu on my P&S; SZ7.4. I have had to learn a new way of thinking about macro with the 2.8 lens. The large lens opening that the 2.8 aperture provides means a faster shutter speed and lower ISO, but it also means a very small depth of field. I've found that it helps to actually shoot macro in aperture mode and increase the aperture in order to increase the depth of field. Also...use one-area metering and change the size and location of the focus to where you want it - as described on page 96 in the manual. Exposure bracket to cover all your bases, and support your camera well or use a tripod. And...as always...macros are better on a cloudy day when you don't have a lot of contrast and shadows.5. The ISO quality is a great improvement over my P&S; SZ7, but not as good as my wife's Nikon D5100. But then, I didn't want the hassle of a SLR. So that's that, I guess.6. This camera feels good in the hand and seems to be very well built.7. The ""handheld night scene setting"" is cool.8. So far, I have not found that the HDR is all that great. I think I would rather bracket and use those photos with a computer-based HDR program.9. If you shoot anything with action, or you like to do fast shooting, a Class 4 SD card isn't going to work for you. You are going to have to move up to a Class 8 or 10 speed to take advantage of this camera's speed. Class 4 will slow you down as you wait for the card to load.10. The new, smooth panorama is absolutely fantastic.11. I love being able to shoot both JPEG and RAW at the same time. I've always wanted to learn RAW, and now I can do so while having the familiar JPEG too. I use Photoshop Elements sometimes - typically just to crop, adjust the levels a little, occasionally adjust a color cast, sometimes clone to get rid of power lines and such, and then unsharp mask (very lightly).12. The two custom white balance controls are very, very convenient and very easy to use. Thank you, Panasonic.13. Having four - check that - four - custom setting is mind blowing. I'm in heaven.14. I'm a little surprised that the scenes menu does not have a snow or beach setting. However, photographing on snow yesterday proved to me that the camera does not seem to need it. Using Program did great, and I suspect iA would do OK too. I forgot to try it. If there is a slight color cast, you can quickly use the color cast correction in any photo touch-up program. But the exposure on snow and sand, which are difficult for most cameras, is great.15. I have found that the Case Logic DCB304 recommended here is too small if you want to carry anything more than the camera. I sent it back and bought the Lowepro Adventura 140 which works very well for me. It has room for the FZ200, my P&S; ZS5, a little tripod, some filters and extra SD cards, and spare batteries for both cameras.It's still half the size and weight of the case my wife needs for her Nikon D5100 body and lenses.16. Dec 3, 2012 - Took a lot of photos at First Night on New Year's eve with the Handheld Night Photograph setting in the Scenes menu. I love it. What a fantastic option for nighttime photos. I also took a number of hand-held photos of lights etc. using the Program setting and they did quite well, though the ISO has to be set higher than 400 to do so. Then took a lOT of photos of a musical group at one of the local coffee shops under incandescent lighting, using both burst shooting and normal program mode. This camera does very well. It is fast - the F2.8 lens is really a great thing. I agree with other reviewers who say that this camera does not do as well with higher ISOs as the Nikon 5100, say. My wife has the D5100 and I can see the difference. But then, I'm not carrying around three lenses and a camera nearly twice as heavy and big as the FZ200. It's always a trade off and it depends on one's priorities. Just try to keep your ISO setting at 400 or below. (But see my additional comments below.)October 21, 2013: I've now taken 100,000+ images with the FZ200 and still love the camera. Some pointers: use the speed setting for long zooms and adjust the speed to the amount of zoom you are using. I find that adjusting the speed to 1300+ when zoomed to 600mm handheld nearly guarantees a sharp photo at that focal length. I shoot a lot from a rocking canoe, so it's not unusual that I need to set an even faster speed. I also set the exposure compensation about a full stop low and then bracket 2/3 of a stop. This gives me choices on editing and brings out the colors and reduces the ISO, which is important since this camera is noisy above 400 ISO. However...and I love this...the free program NoiseWare does a fantastic job of correcting the noise with my computer. With this program I don't worry much about noise. And...along the same lines...reduce the noise correction and sharpness correction to -2 in the Photo Style menu to reduce the occasional artificial look that comes from the internal software in this camera. You can play with the four setting in these menus to reduce some of the camera's unneeded internal software corrections.And listen up, Panasonic, if you monitor Amazon comments: You need to create a screen display item that reminds the user of the side lever setting. It's far too easy to set the focus for macro or manual and then leave it there when the camera is shut down. I've lost some good shots later because I didn't change the focus setting back to auto focus before shutting down and the lens was on the wrong setting. Another option is to reset the focus back to automatic upon shutdown as the default. It's easier to change the side lever than to remember the setting.PackJac","12 15, 2012",A18BQXGJ3RO1BC,Jack,96.0,This is one fantastic camera,65.0,637.0,1355529600.0,1765.0,31.6730604459,16.0529779906,15.6200824553,0.0955927211919,0.0,0.873168816357

It is the product ofdecades of development and expertise. Can one radio do everything you've dreamed of (especially forunder $200?) Yes, it can.My perspective includes decades of listening beginning 47 years ago in 1965. Back then, a standardshortwave radio for a casual listener was not portable. It was a five-tube desktop model that simplyexpanded upon tried and true AM radios found in every household. If you needed advanced features andhigh performance, you would need to invest in an expensive multi-tube boat anchor!Times have changed dramatically. The Sony ICFSW7600GR covers 150 kHz to 30 MHz, featuring adouble conversion design with synchronous detection, along with the 76 to 108 MHz ready for FM receptionworldwide. Gone are mechanical pushbuttons. The Sony challenges you to fill up 100 electronic presetmemories! Included is a multi-zone clock displaying local time and UTC. You can choose regular AM receptionor USB/LSB along with CW. A very useful RF gain control and a display light (for night operation) areprovided, as well. The features go on and on!My smiles began early. I was extremely impressed with its operation. The controls are quite intuitive and simpleto master. I entered one of my favorite frequencies, 14.060 MHz (the 20 meter CW QRP calling frequency) andimmediately heard a one watt station calling CQ. The telescopic whip antenna was down with just my fingerresting upon it. There was no shortage of in-the-clear shortwave broadcast stationsto listen to. How do they make a portable radio this selective and sensitive?More early trials produced more amazing results. Again, with no whip antenna extended, I pulled inseveral time reference broadcasts from America's WWV and CHU Canada. Reverting back to my childhood, Itried aeronautical VOLMET weather frequencies and logged New York, Gander, Newfoundland and Shannon,Ireland immediately with little effort. The precision of frequency direct-entry combined with theclarity of the sideband reception was almost unnerving! Plenty was heard on 30 and 40 meter CW. All Icould say was `Wow!'One transmission lives on through the decades. Radio Australia still broadcasts towards the east,covering the Pacific islands and beyond, every morning on 9580 kHz. They have ruled this frequency fordecades with a dominant signal that is hard to surpass. I took the ICF-SW7600GR to work and tried to pickthem up. Radio Australia locked in with full quieting while standing by a window. I walked into the buildingamong literally tons of electronic equipment surrounded by steel and concrete. The signal could still beheard! I know Radio Australia uses a lot of power but this is miraculous.Longwave reception was also pretty remarkable. Again, with just built-in antennas, I logged NDBs (nondirectionalbeacons) FR 407 kHz in Farmingdale, Long Island and OGY 414 kHz near Jacob Riis Park in TheRockaways in Queens. These stations are used as navigation aids and transmit very slow AM modulatedMorse Code continually. You'll never hear a station more anxious to be logged!The ICF-SW7600GR also offers synchronous detection. You can derive a full AM carrier from justone sideband. This is particularly useful if you have a very strong adjacent station or you are trying tomaneuver through digital IBOC HD Radio interference. I often get clobbered by the digital sideband of KDKA1020 Pittsburgh while trying to listen to WBZ 1030 Boston. Synchronous detection can make this noisymess into something quite listenable. It is certainly welcomed at this listening post.This is a sophisticated radio delivered in a classy manner. It is beautifully designed and quite attractive.The ICF-SW7600GR is the size and weight of a somewhat heavy paperback book. Every button and controlwas found in a logical place which could be easily memorized for in-the-dark middle-of-the-nightreception. The LCD display is big and easy to read. With 100 memories, you don't need to do a lot of directtuning. Multiple frequency comparisons are a breeze. Sony even thought of every final touch. The unit comeswith a very attractive black cloth case. Slip the radio into the case and a fold-over leaf covers it neatlysecured with a couple of pieces of Velcro.I'm sure I have only just begun to appreciate everything this radio can do. I'm still mesmerized withdirect frequency entry. There is no noticeable drift and the battery life seems endless. Sony's operationsmanual goes on for dozens of pages. Also included is the 128 page Sony Wave Handbook, a very comprehensiveall-band guide to familiarize you with the world of shortwave and beyond. A cute self-containedreel of wire, with built-in end clips, is included as a useful portable antenna. Sony included everything youneed to get started immediately. You can become a fairly sophisticated worldband listener by just openingthe box. What fun!The essence of shortwave has not changed that much since 1965. All the bands are still there. You'lleven find several new band allocations for broadcasters have come alive. Like visiting old neighborhoodsfrom your childhood, often the flavor has become something completely new. Many of the old standardbroadcasters are hard to find or gone entirely. The Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and eventhe BBC and Voice of America are missing in action. Many religious stations have popped up along withsome newly dominant Asian broadcasters.As a side note to this review, this receiver can also be used as a fairly accurate frequency counter.Maybe I need to get out a lot more, but nearly everything I use to pursue amateur radio has either inaccurateanalog tuning or dubious digital tuning without reliable accuracy. With a zero-beat accurate SonyICF-SW7600GR around, I can finally discover what frequency I am actually transmitting on!In a reality check, I am certainly aware that this wonderful receiver is really nothing new. Its direct ancestor,The Sony ICF-SW7600G, was first released in 1994 and has nearly every feature the current ICFSW7600GRoffers. This Sony line of compact shortwave receivers can be traced back to 1977 with the release of theoriginal ICF-7600 featuring an analog tuner. The current model employs all the lessons learned from this long legacyto produce a remarkable product. The Sony ICF-SW7600GR is a great deal of fun available for very little money.Get one and enjoy every minute.","08 1, 2012",A1XMMIP11MZCGN,Karl J.

I teach photography as my profession and for any of my ""wildlife classes"" where I take students to the zoo for example, this is usually the lens I bring, oftentimes with a Canon 1.4x EX II teleconverter to increase the focus range up to 320. If I'm going by myself I actually try to bring my 500mm f/4L IS lens with a tripod but for those who know that lens, it's HEAVY and somewhat impractical for zoo photography if there are many people around.Anyway, about this lens (and again, these are my opinions):Canon has been refining the 70-200mm lens for years and this is the latest iteration of the design. The lens has a new optical design utilizing 5 UD glass elements and 1 fluorite glass element. Another nice benefit to the redesign is the slightly closer minimum focusing distance (1.2 meters versus 1.3 meters.) Not a huge improvement on the minimum focusing distance but not bad considering the limitations of a lens of this focus range.The lens uses a constant /2.8 aperture across all focal lengths which is common with a lens of this caliber. You will have ""effective fields of view"" which vary based on the size of the imagine sensor in your camera:* On a full-frame camera, the focal range will of course remain 70-200mm.* On an APS-C sensor camera (Typically a Canon 7D and under) the effective focal length would be 112-320mm.* On an APS-H sensor camera (Canon 1D Mark IV, for example,) the effective focal length would be 91-260mm.PRICING:In terms of pricing (at the time of this review), the lens is available for around $2,100 and ships with the ET-87 petal-shaped lens hood, a fabric lens case, and ring tripod mount. A note about the lens case: It's nicer than the cheaper suede lens bags that ship with most of the smaller ""L"" lenses, but it's not a hard case... more of a nice fabric, semi-rigid zipper case.)If you're looking for this focal range in an ""L-Series"" lens but don't have the $2,100 to spend, a good alternative is the /4 version of this lens which is substantially thinner and lighter, and sells for about $1,200 ($900 less than the /2.8 version.)Sharpness:Anyone who actively shoots with this lens can attest, it's one of the sharpest telephoto-zooms you can buy, even when used wide open at /2.8. It's not tack-sharp wide open of course but stopping it down to /4 will get you as close as you can get.With our APS-C crop sensor camera, we got the best sharpness at 100mm and /4. By /11, diffraction limiting begins to set in, and impacts on overall sharpness. As with most of these lenses, the more you stop down to past /11, the more blur you're going to notice with substantial differences noted at /22 and twice the blur of /22 at /32. A lot of my students like to stop way down like this when they're trying to blur water or motion during daylight. The best way to do this is actually to use an ND filter so you can retain sharpness yet still be able to stop down multiple levels.The full-frame 5D Mark III really put the lens through its paces with the best performance seen at wide-open. Wide open at /2.8, the lens shows its best performance at 70mm, with a generous sweet spot of 1-1.5 blur units in the center of the frame, degrading slightly to some corner softness; around 2 blur units. From 100mm and up we note increasing corner softness and a lessening of that sharp sweet spot until it's just over 1.5 blur units in the center and 2 in the corners at 200mm.Stopping down provides additional sharpness, but never does the lens reach absolute, 1-blur unit ""tack"" sharpness across the frame (it comes very close, for instance 70mm at /8). Still, it's very sharp indeed. At /16 diffraction limiting has set in, with the lens providing a consistent 1.5 blur units across the frame. At /22 the lens shows 2 blur units across the frame, and interestingly, at /32 it shows 3 blur units across the frame (as opposed to the 4 blur units we noted with the 20D at that aperture).Chromatic AberrationYou have to peep very closely to the 100% crops of our sample images to detect any chromatic aberration at all with the Canon 70-200mm /2.8 II; that fluorite element is clearly earning its keep. In short, there is hardly any to speak of, and where it does show is in the corners at either 70mm or 200mm.Shading (''Vignetting'')On the sub-frame 20D, corner shading isn't really an issue with this lens. The only light falloff to speak of is found at 200mm and /2.8, where the corners are just over a quarter-stop darker than the center. Not much to write home about.On the full-frame 5D, it's another story however, with significant corner shading when the lens is used wide open. It's slightly more forgiving at 70mm; at 100mm and greater, using the lens at /2.8 produces corners which are almost a full stop darker than the center. This reduces to a half-stop, a third of a stop and a quarter-stop at /4, /5.6 and /8 respectively. When used at 70mm, this light falloff reduces earlier, with the corners being only a third of a stop darker than the center at /4, and less than a quarter-stop darker at /5.6.DistortionResults for distortion are typical of telephoto zoom lenses, with some barrel distortion at the wider end, and pincushion distortion at the telephoto end. The point of convergence (where there is neither type of distortion) is balanced nicely at around 105mm. As you would expect the distortion isn't as significant with the lens mounted on the sub-frame 20D; it shows just +0.25% barrel distortion in the corners at 70mm and -0.2% pincushion distortion in the corners at 200mm. With the lens mounted on the full-frame 5D, it's a bit more prominent, with +0.5% barrel distortion in the corners at 70mm, and -0.5% pincushion distortion in the corners at 200mm.Autofocus OperationAs an L-class lens with Canon's USM focusing technology, there aren't many lenses which will keep up with the focusing speed of the EF 70-200mm /2.8L IS II USM. It takes well less than a second to go through the focusing range. The lens makes almost no noise as it does this. As well, autofocus results can be overridden at any time by simply turning the focusing ring. The autofocusing speed can also be improved by restricting the focusing distance: a switch allows the user to select between two focusing ranges, either 1.2m to infinity or 2.5m to infinity. The front element of the lens does not rotate during focusing, making life that little bit easier for polarizer users.MacroWhile the lens isn't intended as a macro lens, its minimum close-focusing distance has been improved, at just 1.2 meters (just under four feet). The magnification is 0.21x.Build Quality and HandlingLike all the white-body L-series Canon lenses, build quality on the EF 70-200 mm /2.8L IS II USM is exceptional, incorporating seals for weather and dust-resistance. It's built like a tank, and frankly weighs like one as well. This is a very heavy lens (over three pounds), not one that you're going to want to hand-hold all day. Combined with its image stabilization, a monopod with a ball head would be a great way to work with this lens. If you do have to handhold it though, the IS works very well. Canon claims four f-stops of shake reduction, and we will be hopefully be producing some evidence to discuss the accuracy of this claim in the near future.There are several control and information points on the lens that are worth noting. In addition to the focus and zoom rings, there are four command switches. From top to bottom, you have the focus limiter switch (described previously) and a switch to enable or disable autofocus on the lens (""AF / MF""); there are then two switches to control image stabilization. The first activates or deactivates the system (""ON / OFF"") and the second selects the image stabilization mode, mode 1 (for stabilization both horizontal and vertical motion) and mode 2 (for stabilizing just vertical motion, suitable for panning shots). A window provides distance information in feet and meters, and while there is no depth-of-field scale, there is an infrared index.The focusing ring is quite large (slightly larger than the previous version, in fact), composed of rubber with small ribs about 1 3/4 inches wide. The ring provides excellent manual focusing fidelity, with a slightly smooth resistance and plenty of travel. The ring ends in soft stops on both ends of the focusing spectrum, and will focus past infinity.The zoom ring is composed of rubber with large ribs, about 1 1/4 inches wide. The ring takes about seventy degrees of turning action to go from 70mm to 200mm, and again, the ring is very smooth, firm but not too tight; it requires two fingers to move. Zoom creep isn't a problem with this lens, and there is no lens extension during zoom operations.The ET-87 lens hood is petal-shaped, attaches via a bayonet mount, and adds about three and a half inches to the overall length of the lens. The interior of the hood is flocked to reduce any stray light, and there's a locking mechanism to keep the hood attached to the lens. It's a pricey item: around $75 to replace.The lens features Image Stabilization, and you can see our IS Test for more details there.","05 1, 2013",A1AZ7G19GEHCFB,MoonX,52.0,A must have lens for any professional photographer,11.0,608.0,1367366400.0,1746.0,34.1821428029,16.9566580927,17.2254847102,0.0873085600903,0.0,0.873188218782

I've owned several iPods, starting with the original firewire/clickwheel model, and going through every generation of iPod touch until the fourth. I've owned three generations of iPod nano, at least six different iPod classic models (including the original U2 model, which remains in my household to this day), the original iPod Shuffle, and a large number of accessories as well.I have also owned the Sandisk Sansa Fuze, the Creative ZEN X-Fi, the Diamond Rio 600, and several other MP3 players, the model numbers and names of which I fail to remember at the moment. You can check out my reviews to see some of the glowing reviews I've given the iPods, and the Sansa, and the bad review I gave to the Coby I recently tried out. And this isn't even counting the non-PMP devices that do the job, like the PSP, Dingoo, etc.The point is: I'm not new to MP3 players or PMPs, nor have I skipped the iPod. You'll also note that I have several reviews of MacBooks and other Apple items. I'm not unfamiliar with Apple's offerings.That being said, let me just come out and declare the Zune HD my favorite PMP to date. It's *almost* everything I was looking for in a PMP.First, the aesthetic: The Zune HD is gorgeous. The form factor is slick and compact. The glass-covered OLED screen is lovely to behold. The thing is simply the best-looking device Microsoft has ever made. Granted, that's not saying a lot, since sometimes it seems like Microsoft's design team just kind of shoves components into an ugly casing and calls it a day (Zune 30 comes to mind, as does the original XBox, and the XBox 360, which despite being great devices, are ugly-looking boxes). The Zune looks like Microsoft asked for help in designing the looks of the thing. No complaints here. It's small enough to be the perfect PMP for my needs.The User Interface is equally gorgeous. I find it hard to believe the same company who made Windows ME and the original XBox 360 dashboard is responsible for the Zune HD's UI. Everything flows, and looks good doing it. It's all pretty logical, and even the desktop software makes iTunes look like a dull spreadsheet for music.Another word about the construction of this device: It's durable. I haven't put it through much yet, but I've been looking around online, and between the Gorilla Glass on the front, and the tight construction, it's one tough little device. The best part? Unlike the iPod touch with its shiny metal back, the Zune HD isn't a scratch-magnet. The back is brushed metal, and it's quite durable. This means you can get away with a small case, or a skin, or even going bare if that's your desire, and you won't have to worry about it as much as you would with the iPod touch. Trust me: You CAN'T carry an iPod touch around in your pocket without a case, unless you want that shiny back to be scratched up in no time!The sound the Zune HD produces is excellent. In this regard, it blows the iPod touch away. It's crisp, clean, and makes music come alive. HD radio gives the best radio experience you'll ever have (and provides the ""HD"" in ""Zune HD""), and even if the included earbuds aren't the best, you'll still appreciate what the Zune HD is capable of when it comes to playing music.I like that the Media Button brings up a screen-filling media control panel which allows you to control the playback without needing to look at the screen. With my iPod touch, the media controls were a tiny section of the screen, requiring me to look at it in order to switch tracks or pause. The Zune HD doesn't have this problem, and I appreciate that in a PMP that lacks physical media controls. I'd still prefer buttons for this, but at least the Zune HD makes it work well with a touch screen.Video and pictures are beautiful on the OLED screen. The black is true black, and there's none of the ""negative black"" problem I ran into on the 2nd Gen iPod touch. The colors pop, and there's no ghosting or blurring. Really, if you want a portable video device, this is the one to get.Which brings me to my first CON for the Zune HD: The need to convert video to a Zune HD format via the Zune software. While this also comes up with the iPod touch, I found that the Zune software is a bit slower at this task, meaning your sync takes a bit longer.On the other hand, you can sync wirelessly with the Zune HD, and that's kind of cool. You can sync your videos while you sleep without ever bothering to connect it to your PC, and that's kind of cool.Speaking of the wireless capabilities, I suppose I should mention the web browser. Yes, it works well, and it's pretty zippy with the current firmware. I had no major problems with it, and found it to be a similar experience to web browsing on the iPod touch. I'd call them even on this point, but then, I don't plan to do a lot of web browsing with my PMP.Yes, the Zune HD falls short in Apps. Nobody denies this. Microsoft has opted to make their own Apps, and release them for free. I'm told they used to put ads on them, but that is no longer the case. The ads are just free in the Marketplace, and I find them comparable to-- or better than-- similar iPod touch Apps. The parlor/board games (cards, chess, checkers, etc.) are all excellent, and the solitaire is better than any free solitaire I've found in the iPod App Store. The graphics in some games are really surprisingly good, and I can't wait for Microsoft to crank out a few more games, which they swear is in the cards... In time.Battery life is excellent. Storage space is great for the price. The Smart DJ function is pretty intelligent, and it's especially nice when you have Zune Pass.And that's where the Zune HD kicks the iPod touch's butt: Zune Pass. If you like music, it more than makes up for the small number of apps in the Marketplace. Basically, you pay $15 a month, and you get total access to everything in the Zune Music Marketplace. This isn't just in a streaming capacity, either. This is downloaded music, which will sync with your Zune HD and go with you. It's not just in a limited app, either. It's integrated throughout the Zune experience. If you start Smart DJ and you have a Zune Pass, it will not only pick songs from your collection, but it will mix in songs you'd like from the Zune Music Marketplace.You can also use things called ""Channels"" with the Zune Pass; These are pre-set groups of music by genre/mood that randomize every day when you sync your Zune HD. You really have no limits when it comes to music with the Zune Pass.On top of all those features in Zune Pass, you get to keep 10 tracks every month. For good. They're all yours. When your Zune Pass expires, or you cancel it, you still get to keep the ten tracks you select each month. So really, if you compare this to the iTunes experience, it's like buying 10 songs in the iTunes Store, and then getting to download and listen to the entire store's collection of music. Apple doesn't offer anything like this, and it's a killer feature if you want to explore music.The Zune video marketplace is nice, too. The best part of it is that, if you have an XBox 360, you can buy movies or TV shows from the Zune Marketplace, and they'll be available for your XBox 360, your PC, or sync with your Zune HD.So why only four stars? Well, naturally, it's the App support that causes my only concerns. There's so much potential with this device, and a lot of processing power under the hood, and yet there aren't very many Apps available a year after the Zune HD was launched. Granted, they're getting some good ones on there (if you like Twitter, or Facebook, or need a metronome) but they could do so much more. If only they'd let some third parties (like major game studios) make some Apps for the Zune HD!As it stands, the Zune HD is the best PMP on the market thus far. When it comes to music and video, you would be hard-pressed to find a better device. When it comes to web browsing, it's adequate. When it comes to gaming, it falls short, but still has some potential and provides some time-killers.If the Apps multiply a bit, I'll come back and amend my review with that fifth star.","09 16, 2010",A1J75JJ0Q2OEJN,Raven A.

It's a vast upgrade from the 60D, combining the best features of that body, the T5i, 6D, and 7D, with superior movie motion tracking. It's the first DSLR I can recommend for amateur video without a caveat for slow autofocus. Shooting stills from the rear LCD still favors mirrorless and hybrid bodies, but employing the 70D's viewfinder pulls the advantage back to Canon.I've listed the history of this line so you can get a feel for where it slots.MODEL EVOLUTION:==== 50D /200815MP9-point AF, all cross-points6.3 fps, 16 raw96% viewfinder640 x 480 LCDAF micro-adjustmentAF joystickFlash sync socketCF memory cards==== 60D /2010+ 18MP+ 1080p/720p/480p movies+ Mono mic+ 720 x 480 LCD+ LCD articulates+ Metering improved+ White balance improved+ Wireless flash control+ HDR / MSNR / exposure merge+ Raw conversion and filters on-camera+ Movie crop zoom (7X, 480p)+/- SD cards+/- simplified button layout-- 5.3 fps, 16 raw-- no AF joystick-- no AF micro-adjust-- no flash sync socket-- lesser build==== 7D /2009+ 19-point AF, all cross-points+ 8 fps, 25+ raw+ AF joystick+ AF micro-adjust+ Magnesium chassis+ 100 % viewfinder+ Flash sync port+ Weather-sealing(ish)+ Video sound level adjustment+/- CF cards+/- larger-- 640 x 480 LCD-- LCD won't articulate-- Movie crop zoom-- HDR / MSNR / exposure merge==== 70D /2013+ 20 MP, noise improved+ 'Dual Pixel AF' in Live View+ LCD articulates+ LCD touchscreen+ 720 x 480 LCD+ Wifi built-in+ Silent-shooting w/ viewfinder+ Scene Intelligent Auto mode+ Stereo mics+ Video compression improved+ Movie crop zoom (3X, 1080p)+ HDR / MSNR / exposure merge+/- SD cards+/- smaller+ /- weather sealing+/- simplified button layout-- 7 fps, 16-23 raw-- no AF joystick-- no spot-AF or AF-point expansion-- no flash sync port-- lesser buildViewed from another angle, here's where we've seen the major features before:* 20MP sensor* Dual-Pixel AF* 16-shot raw buffer, 60-shot jpeg buffer (60D)* 19-point AF system (7D)* Swivel LCD screen (60D)* Touchscreen LCD (T5i)* Simplified rear control layout (6D)* Wifi (6D)* AF micro-adjustment (7D)* Stereo microphones (T5i)* Silent shooting through the viewfinder (5D III)* Movie crop zoom (T3i)* IPB and ALL-I video compression (5D III)* On-camera raw conversion, movie editing, and effects preview (T5i)* Scene Intelligent Auto mode (T5i)It's like a greatest-hits album; there's almost nothing from the parts bin that hasn't made an appearance.HANDLING AND NEW FEATURES:No surprise: it feels like a 60D. Small compared to the 40D/50D/7D, but without the handling compromises you'd see moving to a T5i. General build is fine except for the mushy buttons. It isn't brickish like the 7D and the other two to a lesser extent. The difference shows up on the scale: this body mirrors the 60D and weighs 6 ounces less than the 7D, splitting the difference between that and a T5i. Good for travel, though lens weight tends to dictate the DSLR experience at this level.Canon has rejiggered the button layout to match the 6D. A new button near the shutter changes AF modes. Five buttons have switched functions relative to the 60D. Menu adjustments are faster because you can use both thumbs. If you're shooting multiple bodies, the 70D pairs best with a 6D, and the 7D with the 5D III. Earlier bodies require more acclimation.Coming from the 40D/50D/7D, I'm not keen on the rear dial and D-pad. The dial works, it's just small. The D-pad, though, is at least an inch from the AF-on button. If you're using it for direct AF point selection and the AF-on button to AF, you'll wear out your thumb in a hurry. The 40D/50D/7D all have a separate hat-switch in a more ergonomic position. That aside, there's the question of weather-sealing. Regardless of what Canon says, pretend it's a sieve if you're in more than a drizzle. The 'it got wet' repair isn't cheap and the kit lenses aren't sealed.The big addition for the 70D is the touchscreen. The implementation is straight from the T5i: if you can adjust a setting with the physical UI, you can adjust it by touch. This significantly lowers the EOS learning curve. The touchscreen is capacitive and almost as responsive as a modern smartphone, unless you're wearing non-conductive gloves.How does touch change things in practice? If you're a novice, it makes things accessible. Press the Q button to pull up all the major camera functions and tap to adjust. If you're more advanced, it simplifies Live View autofocus. You don't have to place focus points on your subject or pan a focus box with the D-pad. Just tap. It's so much faster. This yields huge dividends when coupled with LCD articulation for off-angle shooting (of high or low objects), studio shooting from a tripod, and most especially with movies, where you have no time for adjustments and don't want to shake the camera by mashing buttons. Picture review also benefits. Phone gestures (e.g., pinch zoom, swiping) make checking focus vastly quicker and more flexible than on any other non-touch EOS camera.Wifi is also new. I didn't care much for it on the 6D, but it's growing on me for one reason: I can get a live feed to my phone with AF control. That's a big deal. You've always been able to remotely trigger EOS bodies with radio transmitters, but you can't preview the shot, change settings, or move the AF point. Third-party software will do all that, but only with a cable. It's always been an either-or thing. Now you can have both with a free Canon app that'll work with Android or iOS.Wireless control opens a lot of creative possibilities. Put the camera on a bear path or strap it to your car. Make it a flexible second-shooter at a wedding or behind a hockey net. Take a selfie or a group shot without prefocusing or hoping there's contrast in front of an AF point. Move pictures to the phone, process in Instagram, and upload to Flickr. Shoot in one room and have an assistant sort pictures in another on a different floor. I'm sure I've barely scratched the surface.Wireless limitations? A few. You can't take or send movies when Wifi is on (and the setting won't change automatically, you'll probably end up binding it to your custom menu), the app has only bare-bones functionality, live preview is sluggish, and a transfer rate of 2 MB/s makes it impractical to move 25 MB raw files. You wouldn't do any better with an Eye-Fi card; the X2 version is about half as fast.Because it combines a touchscreen with most of the hardware controls from Canon's professional bodies, this body leaves a lot of room to grow. It won't be intimidating for long if you're coming from a Rebel.VIEWFINDER AUTOFOCUS:Like all DSLRs that can display a live feed to the rear LCD, the 70D has multiple autofocus systems. The primary is for stills shot through the viewfinder. The other is for stills or movies composed from the rear LCD.The AF array for viewfinder shooting is a 19-point system pulled from the 7D. It covers the same area as the 9-point array from the 40/50/60D/T5i/T4i, but the hit-rate in AI-Servo (Canon's motion-tracking mode) with fast or unpredictable movement improves by at least half. That applies to the full grid and, to a lesser extent, the center point alone. The older system was already a third better than the one in the T2i/T3i/SL1. Thanks to the dense AF grid, the 70D is much less likely to miss during full-grid shooting for lack of having a point on contrast.While it's definitely an upgrade over the 60D, there are few caveats to this system relative to the 7D:First, it has only three of the 7D's five AF modes: Full Auto (19 point), Zone AF (5 zones), and Single-Point (1 point). It's missing Spot AF (1 point, reduced size) and AF Point Expansion (1 point, reverts to local outer points if necessary). Will you miss them? Maybe. Spot AF makes it easy to hit a very small target with a fast lens, like an eye instead of an eyebrow. AF Point Expansion is great for motion when you want to use a specific AF point, but with a fallback so the camera won't give up if that point misses.Zone AF isn't a perfect substitute. It groups points into areas that you can select, but the point chosen within each area is always the one over the closest subject. If your subject is surrounded by other viable closer subjects, that may cause a miss noticeable with a fast lens.Second, there's more button-pressing than with the 40D/50D/60D for single-point shooters. The earlier bodies can directly select the outer AF points (where eyes typically end up in portraits) with one thumb movement. This 70D can't because the rocker only goes 8 ways (plus a center button) for 19 points. There's no custom function to ignore middle points. Zone AF gives the same economy of thumb movement, but without the same precision from each zone.Third, certain older lenses may be more consistent with the 60D system. I've had trouble in the past with false focus confirmations on a 7D paired with a 50/1.4 and 50/1.8. Firmware updates since may have negated that issue; I don't know. The 70D hasn't hinted at it so far. Still, whatever you buy, give it a controlled bench test before you trust it in the field. Even four-digit gear has quality control variation.Three other narrow points of note: like the 7D, this body has AF microadjustment, an AF offset intended to tune out manufacturing variability in lenses and bodies. Third-party, wide-aperture, and telephoto lenses benefit most. Less so lenses with older AF mechanisms (e.g., 50/1.8, 50/1.4) and those that misfocus variably at different distances or lighting. We've also had a custom function switcheroo. The 7D had one for ignoring obstructions in AI-Servo. The 70D replaces that with one that controls sensitivity to objects that change speed erratically. The 70D also loses the 7D's ability to bind an alternate AF point or zone to a button.In aggregate though, I'm pleased with what I've seen so far. Full-grid automatic AF and AI-Servo on the 60D and before were not ideal. The focus points were too far apart, the selection method was not predictable, and AI Servo was not consistent with static subjects. As a result, I used One Shot with single-point selection for most subjects. This 70D is actually usable in full-auto. When I had a 7D, I found myself in full-auto or Zone AF with AI Servo about half the time shooting f/2.8 or above. I see no reason to change that with the 70D, so I'm not as disappointed about the loss of the other two AF modes as I could be.LIVE VIEW AUTOFOCUS:The 70D's Live View AF is a revolutionary feature, so let's start with deep background. Skip the next three paragraphs if you're already familiar.Live View focusing has always been a challenge for true DSLRs. Absent a translucent light-robbing mirror, you can't get a live feed to the rear LCD without disabling the main phase-detect AF array. In the past, that left you with focus from whatever the camera could divine from image data, the same 'contrast-detect' AF used in point-and-shoot cameras, mirrorless bodies, and phones. But unlike phase-detect, the camera doesn't know which direction or how far to focus. So it guesses. And hunts.Fine for still subjects and small sensors if it's done right. Not so much a DSLR; Canon's implementation in every body before the T4i was pretty much unusable with any moving subject. The T4i sensor had a couple of phase-detect pixels in the middle to make things less bad. The SL1 expanded that system to 65% frame coverage, which made it Canon's best hands-off movie DSLR.But the SL1 is hardly perfect even within the phase-detect AF area. It's usable with subjects that don't move toward or away from the camera too quickly (about a third as fast as the main phase-detect AF array could track), but it still gets confused, it's not brilliant in low-light, and there's a subtle back-and-forth focus-racking when it settles on a subject and when tracking anything.Enter the 70D. Canon's made every pixel over the same area capable of phase-detect with a technique they call 'Dual Pixel AF.' And they've done it without any obvious effect on image quality, while ditching contrast-detect entirely for most lenses. Apparently Canon employs wizards.What performance can you expect relative to the SL1 and the main phase-detect array?(+) In Movie Servo mode, it responds almost instantly to scene changes. Focusing on static objects in general is very quick, although a few mirrorless bodies are even faster. Enabling face detection adds a slight delay, and more if there's no face in the scene.(+) Different lenses change focus at different speeds. None of them seem to run at maximum speed. The change algorithm is tuned for pleasing transitions.(+) There's no focus-racking when focus stops. All mirrorless bodies still do this in low light and most in bright light.(+) It keeps subjects that move at one speed in focus instead of repeatedly snapping in and out of focus. Here again, some mirrorless bodies can track things even faster, but the object won't actually be in focus for as long. With the kit lenses in good light, it'll hold focus on a subject moving directly at the camera from close range at 7-10 MPH. Indoors in low light, closer to 3-5 MPH. Movement can be much faster if it's far away or tangent to the camera.(+) Focus accuracy is very high. AF-M does not, and need not, apply here.(+) USM lenses work as fast as STM, though USM may be audible on the audio track in quiet settings. STM lenses are capable of smoother transitions.(+) It works down to EV 0, half the light of the SL1 and almost even with the main array. Almost candlelight.(+) Face-tracking is effective even with conventional indoor household lighting.(+/-) It works with lenses as slow as f/11, a full stop ahead of the SL1 and two ahead of the main array. Not Canon teleconverters, however. A third-party TC that doesn't report the aperture? Maybe.(-) The main array is still more responsive with erratic movement.(-) A few lenses don't work with it. The ones that matter are: 14/2.8L MK1, 24/1.4L MK1, 16-35/2.8L MK1, 28-70/2.8L, and 80-200/2.8L.(-) Contrast-detect is the fallback for unsupported lenses, Movie Crop Zoom, and some teleconverters.It's just incredibly confident. The subject was out of focus. Now it's in focus. If you choose your own AF points, it looks like a professional focus-pull. The only difference is that you can't (as yet) control the transition pace. That may well become an update down the road, and I'm sure Canon will improve speed and predictive ability in future generations. A version of this system may eventually even obviate the main array. But for now, it's good enough. Great, even. Finally.STILLS:Image quality is very good. There's about a half-stop less noise in JPEG and raw relative to the 18MP bodies and less low-frequency blotchiness at high ISOs. JPEG noise processing has improved. Colors are preserved better at high ISOs. I'd run this body to ISO 6400ish for full-res shots. The 6D is two solid stops ahead if low-light is your highest priority.Dynamic range is about the same, though you can add a stop back to the highlights with Highlight Tone Priority. I use that feature constantly in daylight; it's worth the noise to keep the whites intact. Nikon leads here with the D5200 and D7100. Those two also have slightly more detail from their 24 MP sensors, similar high-ISO noise, and less shadow noise at low ISO. Color noise in deep shadows is still there with the 70D, so you can't be quite as aggressive boosting low tones in post.That aside, a deep 16-23 frame raw buffer, 7 FPS (7.5 in raw), and the 7D's AF system make this a legitimate sports camera. It wasn't so long ago that Canon's 1D series capped out at 8 FPS. Stills shooting with Live View is a different story, though. You can still bang out frames at full speed, but you won't be able to see or track anything. The live feed doesn't come back until a few seconds after you've released the shutter button. Focus is fixed from the first frame. Better mirrorless bodies show intermediate frames and continue to focus, but that's partly out of necessity. I don't rely on Live View for scenarios that need quick feedback.MOVIES:If this is your first foray into DSLR video, you'll be impressed. The right lenses give creamy backgrounds and professional-looking subject isolation, often with the subject you actually intended. Such are the benefits of that trick AF system. But don't expect the stills-centric interface to feel quite as natural as that of a purpose-built video camera.The 70D's feature set borrows a few things from the 5D III: 1080p/30, 720p/60, 480p/30, Time Code support, and a choice of IPB and ALL-I compression. Missing are the 5D III's headphone jack, uncompressed HDMI video, live audio gain control, and both Av and Tv modes (M is still available). We might eventually see one or all of these arrive via Magic Lantern's inevitable piggyback firmware. New to the 70D is onboard stereo sound. It has an ambiance that the mono mics from the 60D and 7D can't match, but like every onboard setup, it picks up camera and lens noise in quiet environments. There's a jack for an external mic. Maximum recording time is a half-hour. Battery life is 1-2 hrs depending on temperature, AF use, and lens stabilization, though you can double it with the battery grip.Image quality is Canon's status quo despite the new compression. Color and contrast are strong by default. Resolution hasn't changed: it's somewhat soft at 1080p, but in a way that's only apparent with high-detail scenics or when shown back-to-back with Panasonic's GH3 or a video-only body like the Blackmagic Cinema Camera. Moir&eacute; control (of false coloring and interference patterns on subjects with repeating fine detail) is decent. Better than the 6D, short of the 5D III. You'll still see some edge-crawling with horizontal features. Noise is subtle enough until about ISO 800.A key returning feature is Movie Digital Zoom. It's a menu option last available with the T3i that lets you zoom from 3X to 10X in 1080p mode. The higher zoom levels aren't that interesting, but 3X mode has 1:1 pixel mapping, so you lose very little quality. It's effectively a free teleconverter without the light loss. In 35mm terms, it turns your kit 18-135 into 600mm on the long end. Two caveats: it only works with contrast-detect AF and it can't be enabled while recording is in progress. Macro shooting and the sort of fixed composition and focus shots common to professional productions benefit most.Like the 7D and 60D before it, the sole on-camera editing controls trim the beginning and end of the clip. Achieving that on a computer takes surprising effort. If you're not post-processing, shoot in IPB, trim the footage in-camera, copy it to your system, and use Handbrake or AVS Video Converter to bring it down to a size suitable for Youtube or Vimeo. IPB doesn't hold up to major changes in colors or tone curve in post; choose ALL-I for a more serious production.What are we missing? Mostly out-of-the-box thinking. Given what Magic Lantern has added to the 5D III (raw video, HDR video, a thousand other features) solely through reverse-engineering, one wonders where Canon might have gone. Even the more prosaic 1080p/60 and a less indifferent downsampling algorithm would have been appreciated. Still, I've a greater appreciation for what's already there now that it's actually in focus.LENSES:Both kit lenses are excellent. The 18-135 STM is much improved over the USM version that came with the 60D and earlier kit choices like the 28-135 USM. Strong points include a smooth zoom action, no zoom creep, and nearly inaudible focus and stabilization. It's a little heavy and bulky compared to the 18-55 STM, but I'd still favor the longer zoom range. There's no image-quality benefit to the shorter lens.Some thoughts on future additions:* Primes are often lighter, smaller, cheaper, available in wider apertures, optically better, and subject to less less manufacturing variation. They're less convenient, less versatile, updated less often, and can cause you to miss shots in fast-paced shooting environments.* An f/2.8 lens on this body is just fast enough for most indoor use without flash. You'll want a flash for anything slower. A flash can provide more even, pleasing pictures, at the expense of a bulkier, attention-attracting rig.* Third-party lenses tend to have less initial cost, better warranties, and more aggressive designs. AF and optical performance is often (but not always) inferior to OEM lenses, quality control and service can be less consistent, and resale values are lower. Value varies by lens model. Some are better than the OEM equivalents (e.g., Tamron 70-300 VC, Sigma 35/1.4). Some fill holes in the OEM lineup (e.g., Sigma 50-150/2.8 OS, 30/1.4, 18-35/1.8). And some are lesser substitutes, but still competitive (e.g., Sigma 10-20/4-5.6).Try Canon's 85/1.8 if you're looking for an economical leap in subject isolation relative to the kit lenses.MEMORY:Video chews through storage space. A 32GB SD card is good for about 45 minutes with ALL-I compression and two hours with IPB. 8GB and 16GB cards are plenty for stills. Size aside, interface responsiveness isn't much affected by card speed. Faster cards have three advantages: they can shoot longer high-speed raw bursts (up to 22-23), clear the picture buffer more quickly, and record video at the highest quality without risking a speed warning. In one-shot mode, this difference is invisible; very fast cards would only make sense if you were time-limited on card-to-computer transfers with a USB 3.0, SATA, or Firewire card reader.IN SUM:This is the most significant DSLR Canon has introduced since the 7D. It's the first one I've reviewed without some major caveat. And that's unusual. Canon doesn't often make game-changing cameras. They do what they did with the 30D, T3i, T5i, and 6D: make incremental improvements and leave a lot on the table. That's not what happened here, and so much the better. The 70D is significant because it has most of the 7D's AF unit, which is serious business because Canon differentiates cameras with AF performance. It's significant because Canon has licked the movie AF problem that stopped me from ever recommending a DSLR to normal people for movies, while leapfrogging even Sony's pellicle-mirror DSLR-alikes, a former class leader. And it's significant because it combines these upgrades with a physical and touch UI that makes them accessible to a broad cross-section of users. Truly, well-played.But should you buy one? Maybe. Like every new DSLR, it's expensive, and the old ones depreciate like dairy products. There's no question the major upgrades are in Live View. If you're all about stills through the viewfinder, plenty of bodies from the 40D onward could satisfice. But for videos with moving subjects, this is the zero square. There's nothing from Canon behind it. If I had $700 to buy a movie DSLR that would fit into a small bag, I'd save another $500 and buy a bigger bag rather than take the SL1 over the 70D.vs. 7D - New at $1500, the 7D's a nonstarter. Used at $750 and with the enhancements from firmware 2.0, it's a bargain for viewfinder stills if you don't need silent shooting. It's faster, more usable, more configurable, and built like rocks. It's also short an articulating touchscreen and completely inept in movies without manual focus, but focus peaking in Magic Lantern makes that easier.vs. 60D - New, it's barely half the price of this 70D. Viewfinder focus is pretty decent, the framerate is high enough if you're not relying on your pictures for dinner, and it has the same nifty articulating LCD less the touchscreen. A fine camera. I'd buy that used 7D first without a second thought.vs. T5i - At $750, this camera is $150 more than the 60D. It has the awkward honor of being a consumer-class device that's harder to use in movie mode than the semi-pro 70D. That accompanies a lesser build, lesser physical UI, very small raw buffer, no Wifi, no AF-M, no top LCD, no movie zoom, and the 60D's older phase-array AF. To me, the step down is not worth $450.vs. 6D - This full-frame body has appeared for $1500 in some places. It has far better noise control in low light: almost two full stops on the 70D, with a very sensitive center AF point to match. Physical size and layout are similar, but framerate and motion tracking with the main phase array are way behind, as is Live View AF. No LCD tilt or touch. Full-frame lenses cost half again more. The 70D is a better choice for most people, but weigh the 6D if you shoot methodically and care most about subject isolation and low-light performance.vs. Nikon D7100 - Stills have more detail and dynamic range and respond better to post-processing. The main AF array is better than the 70D's and more configurable, but offset by a 6-frame raw buffer. No LCD tilt or touch. No Wifi. Dual SD cards. AF assist lamp. Intervalometer. The physical UI is better, though the menu UI is less polished, as are some software features. Video can be uncompressed over HDMI and 1080i/60, but motion AF is Rebel T5i-caliber. On the system side, Canon has better service and cheaper lenses in some categories. Stills would have to be a much higher priority than movies to favor this over the 70D.Post if you have any questions -- I'll answer them.

It's what's all other tablets aspire to be, hands down. The problem is that while it's better than the iPad 2, the difference might not be enough.So what's different?  The screen is now 4 times the resolution.  It's the best screen on a tablet, by miles. If you were to display a picture of icecream on the screen you'd be tempted to even lick it. RAM is also now doubled which leads, most notably so far, to less reloading of pages when you use multiple tabs in browsing.  The graphics processor is also better, while the main processor it self remains at the same speeds.  The differences in this, so far, aren't perceivable.  The back camera is also improved but I'm not really sure who's taking pictures with their iPad.  If you go with the LTE option, well that's going to clean the floor with the 3G versions, but that's up to you. On the downside the tablet is now also a little heavier (it is noticeable, but you'll forget about it) and runs warmer with long use (this is also noticeable and you won't be able to ignore it unless you're using a case).  Also Apple changed the polarity of the sleep/wake magnets so now nearly all 3rd party cases that you have from the iPad 2 won't work that way.What's not different? iOS. All the pros and cons are still there. The front camera is also still VGA. While the graphics processor got a nice bump the CPU itself is still the same dual-core.I'm really disappointed Apple didn't improve the front camera.  A VGA camera on a screen this good is just a joke.  The rear camera, a camera I used maybe a dozen times in my ownership of my iPad 2 gets a massive upgrade but the camera I've used for hours of video chat is left where it was (even a year ago the VGA camera was terrible).  I can only assume it was left off to provide some feature for the next iPad.  What this product ultimately highlights now are the shortcomings with iOS. Aside from putting a better front camera in the device and addressing some of the backwards steps with the iPad 3 (temp, weight) there's really nothing else Apple can do with this device.  The main hold over from the iPad 2 was the screen and that's been solved now.  Apple needs to, and appears to be doing (but slowly), work on the OS itself.  It's somewhat troubling that by and large iOS 5.1 looks and operates the same as iOS3 and 4.  The most notable of improvements has been the addition of the multitouch gestures and the addition of the notification system.  All nice additions but they don't really represent 2 years worth of changes.In comparison to the iPad 2 this is a nice upgrade, but ultimately it's not enough.  I'm not sure anything could have been enough to be honest though, but the fact that it runs hotter and is heavier don't help it in comparison.  While the screen is appreciable, the screen on the iPad 2 is still amazing in it's own right. If anything it's not a comment on poor quality of the new iPad but rather just that the iPad 2 was already so good.  The new iPad is a worthwhile upgrade from the original iPad or great for a first time buyer.Pros:++Screen++Extra RAM+iPhone and iPod touch based games now use their retina display apps for upscaling on the iPad (this is a REALLY nice improvement when you do use it).Cons:--Front facing camera is still the same-no new OS version = same old same old (e.g. no Siri)In addition, I'd like to compare this to Android tablets in general as I own both.  Android itself represents a better operating system.  Notifications are better, multitasking is better, and just the general usability of the device is better - especially with regard to the home screen.  What Android tablets fail to deliver, however, is the smoothness and richness that iOS offers.  Scrolling on a webpage in iOS versus in Android is just effortless.  It really shows off the imperfections of Android in general, much like how Android shows off the short comings of iOS.  The other issue is app selection.  Android doesn't have the heavy media hitters.  No Hulu Plus, no Xfinity, no HBO Go, no EA games, and just a general lack of quality applications (Android 2.2/2.3 based tablets and the Kindle Fire are exceptions but I'm focused on iOS 5 versus Honeycomb or ICS).  While the Google apps are hands down better on the Android side, they don't make up for the lack of entertainment on the iPad.  Also to note, a lot of the Android apps really don't feel like they take any advantage of the screen size difference, many of the apps feel just like scaled up phone applications where as iPad apps seem to have more thought put in to them for the extra size.While Android often times offers better and more features in it's core implementation, none of that matters when there's so little in comparison to do.  And nearly none of the things they both do are done as well on Android or as smoothly.  Yes, I miss widgets, GTalk integration, and a variety of other things when I use my iPad, but I ultimately use it a lot more because there's more to do.  If you own an Android phone (I do) there's not much really the tablet can do that my phone can't do already, so ultimately it just feels pointless.And I think that's a good point to consider.  Unless you hate Apple/iTunes, if you own an Android phone you'd probably be better off with an iPad to complement the phone.  Likewise might hold true for people who own an iPhone, an Android tablet might be better than the iPad.In the end, if you're looking for a tablet, get the new iPad.  Android may do more things on the front, but there's just less to do on it in most cases.  If you already own an original iPad or an Android tablet - this is worth the upgrade.  However, if you own an iPad 2, unless you really need LTE (and you won't tether your phone) this is a pass.  I made the change to get more storage space primarily (32GB wasn't cutting it anymore) but if not for that I'd have kept the iPad 2 instead.  It's becoming clear the iPad is best bought every other year.","03 26, 2012",ACEB83MWVDWLB,William B.

The company has survived largely because of good business practices and listening to the needs of photographers.The Fujifilm X20 is a camera in which I had been highly interested since the release of this and the Fuji X100s early this year. I had looked seriously at the Fujifilm X10 last year, but there were some subjective needs that for me it didn't meet, so it was passed on. I'm glad that I waited, as the number of improvements over the X10 is quite large. There are said to be about fifty improvements that have been made, but in all fairness, I won't get into a Fuji X20 vs. X10 comparison here, as my experience with the earlier model was limited to just a few days use.Getting right down to the subjective points, followed with a more detailed look based on personal use, here are my basic observations.&#9670; Pros:+ Excellent retro design; solid build quality coupled with good contemporary ergonomics+ Sharp 4x optical zoom; comfortable 28mm to 112mm f/2.0- f/2.8 equivalent, image stabilization+ Has a 7-blade aperture diaphragm; contributes to excellent bokeh effects+ EXR Processor II dual CPUs; cold start-up time about  second, super-fast sequential shooting+ Near-instant autofocus; virtually no time lag when the shutter button is pressed+ New 2/3-inch X-Trans CMOS II sensor; 12MP, offers excellent image quality+ Hybrid AF; autofocus instantly switches between high-speed phase detection AF and contrast AF+ Front focus selector dial; AF-S (single autofocus), MF (manual), AF-C (continuous autofocus) modes+ Advanced OVF; optical viewfinder offers exposure info overlay via Digital Trans Panel, 85% coverage+ 2.8-inch color LCD monitor; approximately 460,000 dots, 100% coverage+ Excellent ergonomics; rational array of controls, easy to master+ Rechargeable NP-50 Li-ion battery; averages 190 - 220 shots per charge depending on settings, actual+ Full manual exposure plus Program, Aperture- and Shutter priority modes and more+ Uses readily-available SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards; full support+ RAW (RAF format) support; also offers JPEG and RAW+JPEG+ ISO range is 100-12800 (in Auto); control available up to ISO 3200+ Excellent ergonomics; raised grip area on the body with a thumb rest, add to handling+ Threaded socket on shutter button; allows for threaded cable releases, soft shutter buttons+ Made in Japan; all of Fujifilm's X-Series cameras are made in Japan+ Built-in advanced filters; allow a choice of 8 artistic effects&#9670; Cons:- Battery life could be far better- Wish this camera would go to 24mm wide angle- Picky point: the X20 lacks a built-in neutral density filter&#9670; First Impressions:The X20 came well packaged in a distinctive black box, and from the moment it was opened and taken out, the feel of a solid, precision camera was quite apparent. This is truly a camera for advanced users, or pros looking for a good backup or weekend camera. It's crafted from a die-cast magnesium alloy, and the ergonomically placed mode dial and zoom ring are milled from solid aluminum. The professional feel is there, and is reminiscent of its more costly brother, the Fujifilm X100S, and along with its overall retro styling is a small engraved ""Fujinon Lens System"" logo on top, reminding us of some of the classic 35mm rangefinder cameras of the past. And on the rear, just to the lower right of the LCD screen, is the discretely engraved ""Made in Japan"" note in white letters against the black of the camera body.Followed the directions in the printed instruction manual and charged the battery for about two hours while reading and going through the box contents. The X20 came packaged with the following:&#9679; Rechargeable NP-50 Li-ion battery&#9679; BC-50B battery charger with US plug attachment&#9679; Shoulder strap with protective pads&#9679; Triangular strap clips & attachment tool&#9679; Lined push-on metal lens cap&#9679; Proprietary USB cable&#9679; CD-ROM (with MyFinepix Studio 4.2 viewer software, RAW file converter, etc.)&#9679; 141-page owner's manual (1-Egnlish, 1-Spanish)&#9679; Fujifilm USA warranty directionsThere's something to be said for Fujifilm's attention to detail with this camera, as they've supplied a small plastic attachment tool with the triangular strap clips. That means no more scratches on the body or broken fingernails while attaching the camera strap clips. The BC-50B battery charger indicator glows steadily when charging, and cuts off when the battery is topped up. I put the USB cable in a safe place (it's proprietary, so don't lose it), and once the battery was fully charged, inserted a Class 10 SDHC card and took the X20 out for a trial run to get a feel for it.&#9670; The X20 in Use:Following the instruction manual, I did some preliminary setups, setting the camera to its Quick Start mode from the Fuji X20's power management menu. The first thing that I noticed was the exceptionally fast start-up time, which only took about  second. Shutter lag is almost nonexistent while in this mode, and on top of that, the autofocus is incredibly quick, perhaps the fastest that I've ever encountered. Technically this is due to the X20's built-in phase detection and its ""Intelligent Hybrid Autofocus system,"" but from a practical perspective of a user who could care less about specs with an eye in the viewfinder, this is exceptionally good for action photographers and street shooters.Speaking of viewfinders, the X20 has an excellent and highly useful optical viewfinder, one that's far more functional than my older Nikon P7100 and many other similar cameras. The optical viewfinder shows 85% coverage continuously, which is fine, and there's a diopter adjustment which is good for those of us with corrective vision. But it also has a Digital Trans Panel that shows highly useful information, such as aperture, shutter speed and focus area. There's a sensor next to the optical viewfinder that automatically senses when the camera has been lifted to the eye, and it turns off the rear LCD screen when you do so. It took a few minutes to get used to this, but after awhile I found that I was using the optical viewfinder far more than I ever did with the Nikon P7100, which was a surprise. It's also good when you have a sun in the face shooting situation.The X20 has a 460,000 dot, 2.8-inch TFT LCD screen. It's a decent screen that's bright and clear, enough so that it deals with reflections and glare fairly well.  This high-contrast screen has a wide viewing-angle, and makes dealing with its excellent GUI menu system easy. That said, it's slightly disappointing that it doesn't have the +920,000 dot 3-inch LCD display found in theNikon P7700and other premium compact cameras currently on the market. It's not a show-stopper, but a subjective consideration.As expected, the camera offers complete PSAM control along with other settings from the top mode dial near the shutter button. There's a good sized exposure compensation control to the right of the mode dial, useful when taking photos of very bright, dark or high-contrast subjects, which offers  EV in one-third increments. On the front is the front focus selector dial, offering AF-S (single autofocus), MF (manual), AF-C (continuous autofocus) modes. There are plenty of other controls on the camera, each offering specific ways to manage various settings and options.In regular use, I found a mild irritant in that the X20 powers down automatically after a few minutes. When this happens, you have to twist the on/off mechanism on the collar surrounding the lens barrel to turn it on again. There is a workaround: go to the menu, and find the standby mode. Setting this means that you can have the camera wake up by gently depressing the shutter button, which is quite practical if you're often in this situation.There's a Q (Quick Menu) button next to the menu controls, and it's quite handy. It displays the most frequently accessed settings on a single screen so that you can quickly navigate to each setting individually and use either scroll wheels to change the value or function of the setting. This made access of the various functions such as ISO settings, white balance, dynamic range, image size and such to be far easier than exploring the camera menus. Tried various shots accessing trying film simulation, the different metering settings and such, all as part of the learning experience. This shortcut method is far better than digging into the viewfinder menus to access the various features. Some magazine reviewers have suggested that it might be better if the X20 had a touch screen so that one didn't have to scroll around the quick menu, but I disagree. If you own a smartphone or tablet, such as a Kindle Fire, just imagine those same streaks and smudges on the screen of the camera. Simply put, the small Quick Menu button, along with the programmable Fn (Function) button on top, quickly became my allies.&#9670; The Lens and More:I've been a fan of Fujinon since my 4x5 view camera days when I owned a superb Fujinon 90mm f/8.0 SW lens, and it's good to see that the same attention to detail found then has carried through onto the X20. For the technically minded, its 4x optical zoom is made up of 11 glass elements (not plastic) in 9 groups, including 3 aspherical lens elements and 2 ED lens elements, with a proprietary HT-EBC coating applied to control flare and ghosting from appearing on images. It's also image stabilized, which helps for low light shooting without a tripod.What this means to you and me is that we have a metal barreled lens that performs beautifully, offering sharp, clear images throughout its entire range. The zoom action is smooth, and it offers both a Macro and Super Macro mode, allowing you to get as close as 0.3"" from your subject. The lens incorporates 7 diaphragm blades which enable you to create a good-looking soft 'bokeh' effect to make your subject stand out from the background perfectly, especially at the f/2.0 aperture setting. At 28mm you have a maximum aperture of f/2.0, and its f/2.8 at the 112mm telephoto end, so the lens is plenty fast.You might find the occasional compact digital with a 4x lens that's as good as the one on the X20, but you'll be very hard pressed to find one that's better, at least not yet.Regarding image performance, the colors produced in images are pleasingly saturated without being overdone. The standard color setting (Provia) is good for most situations, while for portraits you may want to play with the Astia color setting, which renders images with a softer look for better skin tones. The Velvia emulates a more saturated fine-grained slide film, which is the choice of many nature and landscape photographers but you should explore these film emulations to see which is best for your shooting.The X20 has an increased sensitivity ISO range going to ISO 12,800, but for best results, you may wish to stick between ISO 100 and 800. At ISO 1,600 you'll begin to get soft details with some grain present, and beyond ISO 3,200, contrast drops and noise becomes noticeable. These are subjective observations, and your level of acceptability may be different.A full 360 panorama can be shot, and the panoramic options can be found in the Advanced mode.The Advanced Filters selection offer a choice of eight artistic effects, and you can preview the effect on the LCD monitor before you press the shutter button. These filters cover High Key, Low Key, Soft Focus, Toy Camera (with shaded borders), Miniature, Pop Color, Dynamic Tone, Partial Color (retain one color and change the rest of the photo to b&w;), along with multiple exposure. Have not fully explored all of these filters, but the High Key and Dynamic Tone filters are surprisingly creative for in-camera work.Video performance of the X20 was good, and resulted in sharp details and excellent colors, though I'll admit that I'm an infrequent video shooter and easily satisfied in this regard. The continuous autofocus on the X20 performs well with a gradual transition from close to infinity. You can shoot 1920 x 1080 Full HD videos, and the onboard stereo microphone also picked up ambient sounds clearly. There's a movie setting on the mode dial, but be aware that there is no dedicated video button.There's a built-in automatic flash (referred to as the ""Super intelligent Flash""), and for snapshots and the like, it works fairly well. You slide the pop-up switch on the rear of the camera, then select from a variety of modes from the selector to the right of the menu button, such as Auto, Forced Flash, Suppressed Flash, Slow Synchro and Red-eye Removal. It does a reasonably good job, and the built-in red eye works well. If you're serious though, you may want to look at a more powerful flash to mount onto the X20's hot shoe.&#9670; Other Observations:The battery life for the X20 is listed in the specs as being approximately 270 frames, but if you're a heavy user, especially if you have the camera configured for performance shooting, you may find that you get somewhere between 190 and 220 actual shots. During one session taking rapid sequence shots, the battery warning indicator came on at ~150 shots. This is not surprising for this or most other digital cameras, and luckily theFujifilm NP-50 Li-ion Rechargeable Batteryis readily available and worth getting as a backup. Owners of other Fuji digital cameras may already have this battery, as it's the same one that came with my older Fujifilm F300EXR, which is still in service. In any case, it's highly recommended that if you go for this camera, get yourself this backup battery.The zoom lens is threaded for 40mm filters and accessories, and don't make the mistake of ordering a 40.5mm filter. That half a millimeter does make a difference, so if you want a UV or protective filter on the front of the lens be sure to get the 40mm size. The other option would be to go for theFujifilm Lens Hood LH-X10, a two-piece unit that screws into the 40mm threaded end, yet allows for a vast array of commonly available 52mm filters... and Nikon DSLR owners probably already have a number of these.If the Fuji LH-X10 is a bit rich for your blood (check the price), theLens Hood LH-JX10 for Fuji X10 with Lens Adapteris a perfect replacement at a far lower cost, and it accepts 52mm filters just like the original LH-X10. I bought this along with aFujifilm Camera Lens Filter PRF-52 Protector Filter (52mm), and both are on my X20 right now.I looked at considered a number of case options for the X20, and while there are some nice retro-look leather cases by Fuji and others, found that theThink Tank SubUrban Disguise 5 Compact Shoulder Bagwas perfect for my individual needs, as can be noted in my review of bag. It holds not only my Fuji X20, but myNikon P7700as well, where either could be grabbed easily and quickly on a moment's notice for fast street photography or action shooting. This solves the problem of where to carry spare batteries, my Android phone and other essentials, along with protecting all against an accidental rain shower.Speaking of retro, there's a slightly-overlooked feature, and that's with the shutter button. Look closely and you'll see that it's threaded like the old 35mm rangefinders from years ago. This means that if and when you're using the X20 on a tripod, you can employ amechanical cable releasetime exposures or for macro photography. There are many different one available here. You can also use a soft shutter release button that screws into that same threaded socket for greater control. It's a nice touch.To be honest, I did not install the MyFinePix Studio software that comes on the CD. For some it may be a decent, basic way of importing and viewing your photos to your computer, but I cannot offer an opinion. For Adobe users, Camera Raw 7.4 and DNG Converter 7.4 became available as a final release on April 2nd, 2013 as announced by Adobe's Lightroom Journal. The good news for Adobe users is that among others, this upgrade specifically impacts the Fujifilm X20 and the X100S. If you use Adobe software, you know what to do, and enough said on this.If you want a small point-and-shoot digital camera that slips easily in a pocket, this isn't it. The X20 will fit in many large coat pockets, but is best carried in a bag, a case or around your neck, ready to shoot. The strap might be worth replacing, as its non-slip pad actually chafes the neck if you're wearing a short sleeve or t-shirt in warm weather. This became an annoyance during the first warm day of shooting this spring.If asked to recommend a better digital camera to advanced enthusiasts, pros looking for a DSLR backup, or amateur photographers wanting to break into street photography, this would be a good choice. And if I had to personally pick one as a sole camera for weekend travel photos, this would be within the top of a very narrow list.Note: this review will be 'dynamic' in that as other findings with the use if the X20 will be noted here. Major notes and additional resources will be noted in the comments.&#9670; Update 5/10/2013:After putting the X20 through its paces with thousands of images since it was received, I've ordered a total of three extra Fujifilm NP-50 Li-ion rechargeable batteries as noted in the link above. These have settled down to giving about 200 to 230 exposures per charge. I did order and try a lower-priced third party battery, and after three charge cycles, that battery was only giving 120 to 130 shots. Trashed that one.Also found that theSanDisk Extreme Pro 8 GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Cardwith its 95MB/second write time proved to be perfect for sequential high-speed no-lag shooting. This size outlasts the batteries, but there are larger sizes available. Just remember to format it within the camera, and not on a PC or Mac.Also see the comments here for additional findings, and yes, I do respond to questions as can be seen there.&#9670; Update 5/23/2013:&#9733; Firmware Update Notice &#9733;On 5/16/2013, Fujifilm Global published its X20 Firmware Update Ver.1.02, a standard procedure for digital cameras where the user can update the camera. This firmware update is only for the X20, and does not apply to the X10 or any other models. You'll find details on this update in the comments section to this review on this date as outside links cannot be posted within the body of the review.&#9670; Summary:TheFujifilm X20is one of many in a growing field of advanced digital compact cameras, and the competition continues to grow. But Fuji has been good in listening to the photographers' needs, and along with the new Fujifilm X100S, we see generational cameras that are more evolutionary than revolutionary. The +50 improvements in the X20 over its predecessor back this up. The Image quality and resolution we find here push it up to class-leading levels, and few can offer a better lens and sensor-size combination. Image quality and a multitude of user options are half the reason that I personally find the X20 to be so good; superb performance and excellent ergonomics make up the rest.4/8/2013; Updated 5/10/2013, 5/23/2013","04 8, 2013",AEJAGHLC675A7,John Williamson,90.0,Fujifilm X20: Superb performance + excellent ergonomics &#9733;[Updates]&#9733;,199.0,1198.0,1365379200.0,3451.0,22.7623152929,11.2804316125,11.4818836805,0.131025985316,0.0,0.873152110448

Once I got it home before unboxing it I decided to go online and look at what others were saying. I'll admit, I was a little nervous about the results I would get from some of the issues others were having. I decided to give it a shot anyway to see if I was one of the lucky ones.Turns out I was and I absolutely love this router!I am coming from an old D-Link Gamerlounge with a D-Link dir-601 used as an AP. This setup has been very good for several years but it was time for an update. I rarely had any problems with Netflix buffering but I did find a huge bottleneck once I started working with file transfers back and forth to my newly built media server.Here's what's on my network at any given time:1 - server2 - desktops2-3 - laptops3 - Roku boxes2 - cell phones2 - tabletsand various guests coming and going.There were a couple features that really sold me on this item.First, the USB ports and built in print server. My wife uses her desktop for work and had a printer connected directly to it. I never really printed that often until recently so I always just transferred files over to her computer to print them as needed. I never took the time to get the printer sharing working correctly because like I mentioned I didn't have a huge need for printing from my PC. My wife is now moving towards using her laptop for work and still needs printer access. Instead of running a USB cable across the room and hooking it to my computer and setting up printer sharing I was able to just hook the printer directly into the router (they are within 2ft. of one another). Install the Netgear USB control center and we're off. The only issue I had was when attempting to use the airprint feature on my phone. That clogged up the lines of communication between the printer and other computers. Resetting the printer took care of the issue. So, for now I cannot print from my phone, but honestly I don't know that I would ever really use that feature. I only wanted to test it out.Second, was the other USB port that can be used to hook up an external hard drive. We both do tons of stuff with images and videos and even though we have sufficient internal storage it's nice to have something to back up to just in case. And, it's USB 3.0 to boot. I currently am using an internal hard drive which I installed in an external enclosure. Looking online I found a new enclosure I could pick up for around $10 that was USB 3.0. That will hopefully boost the speed of file transfers.As I mentioned earlier, I had trouble with slow transfers to and from my server. Since my server sits in the basement and runs headless I found it much easier to rip and convert our DVD collection on my computer, then transfer the files. Initially I used Teamviewer to access and transfer files to the server. Then I found out that it has limitations on the speed of transfers. So I set up a homegroup and accessed the server that way. With my old setup and using gigabit cards in all computers my top transfer speed was around 30MB/s. I figured because of the hard drives I was transferring to were WD Greens that they may be the bottleneck on speed. So I didn't expect much better from the new router, but tried it anyway just to see. The transfer speeds now range from 55MB/s to 60MB/s. A considerable improvement.When setting up the router I chose to not use the genie and do it manually. Honestly it was a very straight forward process and the only thing I had issues with was the guest network. I'll need to revisit this later, but for the time being I don't see that it would be all that helpful. It would only be used for somebody that is visiting for a short period of time and they would likely only have their phone or possibly a tablet to connect.One thing I did not do was update the firmware. I figured if it's not broken, don't fix it (or in the case of many reviews...If it's not broken don't break it). I will keep an eye on what others are saying about the latest firmware and once it seems to be stable enough for the masses I'll go ahead with the upgrade. Until that time I see no reason to risk it.Signal strength is outstanding! I have a 1500 sq-ft home (not huge) on a 1/4 acre. The router sits downstairs in the far back corner. I've looked at the signal strength throughout the house and at the farthest point the signal is at 86%. The way our home is situated our piece of land I am able to get a strong signal throughout the entire yard. At the far back corner of our yard the strength is still at 53%. I would imagine that our neighbors could easily get a good signal if they had access to the network.So far, I have only played with the basic features of the router. I look forward to sitting down and reading over the manual (wish it came in the box) and seeing what features I didn't realize it had. I doubt I will use the QoS settings because we haven't had a single issue without them. I'll revisit the guest network at some point and get that figured out.Overall, I think this is a very solid product that will last us until the next generation of products hit the market. I do not foresee having to upgrade again for at least a few years. So far it has worked great for streaming multiple HD videos at the same time, I've noticed no issues with gaming (about the same as my old Gamerlounge) and of course basic browsing is as good as always. For me the value was in the print server, shared storage, faster file transfers and greater wifi range.I can't wait to dig into the more advanced features to see what there is! Maybe I'll have a go at setting up a VPN....","03 1, 2014",A2189Q7BCTXL8E,boogers,51.0,Didn't have the problems others experienced,14.0,441.0,1393632000.0,1101.0,41.5438597116,21.3544380248,20.1894216867,0.0736018346849,0.0,0.87287408529

I had VIZIO 22-inch 2012 model in white no issues with that one. But let me tell you this one I didn't know it's their top of the line model for 24-inch LED/LCD HDTV with Smart TV.Getting this home and this was for the outdoor patio I have roof so it won't get wet. Mounted this on the masonry block using the stand sold here called: VideoSecu TV Wall Mount Articulating Arm Bracket for VESA 100 LCD LED Flat Panel Screen TV and Monitor ML10B 1E9.Now taking this out of the box and mounting using the 4x screws from VideoSecu works out just find. You have up to 30lbs weight of a HDTV that can be mounted. So techically speaking I could install the VIZIO 29-inch LED HDTV (this one is not 1080p) it's the old 720p which you don't want because when it comes to modern computers it will not display 1920x1080p. It will do 1080i @60hz but you can't do blue-ray and games that requires full HD.But just to let you know this set does, but quality of the image is poor, along the edges of the image being shown.Also I don't use CATV anymore so I have everything connected via two 40-mile HD-ANT (80-miles with two of them plus the ant joiner) also purchased here from Amazon called: RCA ANT751R Outdoor Antenna Optimized for Digital Reception.First scan of 70 channels and yes I have 70 channels they keep on adding more channels that you get from CATV non-premium ones. VIZIO does scan all the channels but it failed on two and added them as live stations. Those are analog and are not used. Compared this set to SONY, Element Electronics and Toshiba which don't add no working channels to the line-up.Once you get through loop, you have to setup the VIZIO WiFi is what I could only use because of where it was going. The set does have Ethernet port on the rear. You can't miss it huge impact on the box.What I've learned from VIZIO Customer Service Tech in SD, is the WiFi ANT used inside this HDTV is weak not as strong as it suppose to be. This is another reason why I had so much issues. My WiFi here I use the ESR600H sold on Amazon also. Strong signal WiFi Router used as AP (access point). It has 4x 5dBi ANT two external SMA removiable and two of them internally.  Plus this unit has high amp.VIZIO telling me the HDTV is not getting enough signal. The but the set is showing 5 bars and in the system info report shows the signal is 100%. The issue is the way the HDTV was first designed. They don't want you to use WPA2 they want you to leave it open, which doesn't make sense.Networking on this suppose to be easy for those who don't understand how everything works. But setting the set to DCHP by default where you should use Static IP address instead so it doesn't keep changing in the main router the IP address. Even if I do the correct way it still doesn't allow Amazon Prime Instant Videos to display or even load.The other issue is with Netflix after all the tweaking and clearing of memory and resets to factory defaults doesn't do really anything than it did prior.So if you hoping that WiFi going to work, you better search about this model before you decide to buy it or not.Final outcome from Netflix Customer Service Tech was that the VIZIO will not talk to our servers. He was right it will not and when it tries to I get that ERROR TVP-805. Always.Sound on this set sound like the first VIZIO Razor LED I had back in 2007/2008 was a nightmare. Last year was the first time trying them again on the Kitchen HDTV 22-inch. That one works. Why can't this VIZIO 24-inch do the same with Smart TV.Smart TV is based on Yahoo, so best you have that account. Your going to need it. Otherwise you'll be in Guest mode always.Of course you can remove the apps from the list, and just keep what you want. So many of them.  about 23 apps that needs to load. That's nothing I had updated the HDTV via internet yes, that works on this but only on certain apps via WiFi. Now how is that possible when I just said Amazon Prime Instant Videos and Netflix app didn't function right?I know, but again certain features work and some are not ready. Yes I have the latest firmware for 7/13. But let me tell you out of the box the update only was 18 apps. The set only did up to 23 apps after I had to reset it 4x times.I've tested a few apps to see how they work with my WiFi network setup. Vudu works, in HDX so this is real odd how some apps works and some don't. To watch Vudu in HDX you need a strong internet which I do have.Downloads 132 mbps and uploads 22 mbps. I own 8x SONY SMP (N100 and N200) these are network Media players which offers the features of what you have in a Smart TV but they allow you tap into your Windows 7/8 shared folders for Music, Pictures and Video. Where the VIZIO HDTV Smart TV doesn't give you that option. It's just are Internet Smart TV that's it!Youtube works also just to let you know, the quality in the imaging on this HDTV is not smooth  with the edges of the subject or object on the screen. That's now how it suppose to be unless the set is using Compressing to send smaller packets (data) through.What you get from the set is very sparse on inputs: 1 HDMI, 1 Component plus L/R Audio, 1 Composite L/R Audio, 1 Ethernet Port,  1 RF Coax - CATV/DTV, 1 15-pin VGA port PC, 1 Optical OutLast year VIZIO HDTV 22-inch White you get 2 HDMI all of the above except for the Ethernet port.The VIZIO 2013 this model the remote has all the features you need to control the set, but there is another remote for with more keys sold here on Amazon for $11 bucks. E241i-A1 - VIZIO XRV1TV Qwerty keyboard.Instead the box the PSU power code is very different you don't really see those types in a TV more in radio or small PSU. Also the cord is short too. Two AAA batteries, the stand (cheap plastic type) This was use in the VIZIO 22-inch had one just like it. The design of the 2012 model is better up front. Has curve at the bottom for the speakers. Thus this allowed me to mount it over my Microwave.This model doesn't give me that option to do that, it's larger, but again the size of the VIS = visual image size is smaller. VIZIO unless stated true 24-inch edge to edge. This model VIZIO E241i-A1 really 23.56"" and my VIZIO E220VA White 22-inch was 21.53"".Do be warn that the front of the set is busy with ID brand tags in grey over glossy black. White is also available seems more pure white than the E220VA White model I have in the kitchen right now seems off-white a bit, but the box read white on it.Also one more thing these sets are not high contrast using coated panel that gives off a shine to it or also called Ultra Bright Panel. Gives you the appearance of glass but not really glass. Without this features colors and dark areas won't be at their best.Need to go into a store that carries this model and test it out. Then get it off Amazon to save on the purchase.After all what was said I had returned this set for Toshiba 23L1350U which has 23/23-inch display so it's true 23-inch. E241i-A1 gives you 23.56 so you get .56-inch more.23L1350U, not a SmartTV Toshiba calls that CloudTV on certain models it offers it. I don't need that feature and already have 8x SONY SMP-N100/N200 here which doesn't give me the trouble with WiFi on the apps included Netflix, Amazon Instant Video an etc.. all play 100%.Yes E-Series 241i-A1 takes 8 seconds depends on your model but even in the store it didn't start up so quickly after the logo ""V"". Toshiba start quick after ""Toshiba"" red logo started. Both models are new built in 2013.Toshiba has 3-HDMI ports, 1080p LED Slim, full DTV Info Guide and Special Audio System EQ for more detail to sound quality really loud.I have it paired up with: Philips 5.1 Home theater 3D Blu-ray player HTS3541/F7 also sold here on Amazon. The audio sync up with the Toshiba meaning you turn up the volume and it points to the Philips when the Philips is managing audio surround.Again do test out what you buy first, if you can. If you don't need a (Smart TV (does require internet access) Wired or Wireless Router too. Cable or DSL modem. Smart TV features add more to the HDTV package, If that features doesn't work 100% then you'll end up like me returning it for a model that doesn't offer it.Good Luck!","07 21, 2013",A3AQVLV3RP7R2L,"tipstir ""My Professional Review""",62.0,SmartTV Glitch,7.0,623.0,1374364800.0,1655.0,19.6086042931,9.66048734656,9.94811694652,0.151519556736,0.0,0.872852620948

I know... because I did...- has radio and voice recorder- good looking, has a small screen which displays everything you need to know- lightweightCons:- the battery cover looks fragileThere are workarounds to all the other complaints that the other reviewers have.About my MP3 player: I have the Sep 9, 2005 Rev 2 firmware. I formatted my MP3 player with the FAT32 file system and have only used Windows Explorer to transfer music to my MP3 player, to transfer voice recordings to my computer and to delete files from there. I got this MP3 player for Christmas and it has never froze. I have only used shuffle mode a handful of times and have had no problems with it.Some people have complained that the menus are hard to use. What do you expect when SanDisk tries to pack all these features into such a small player??? Were you expecting a Bluetooth enabled wireless mouse and 19 inch flat monitor??? It took me about 5 minutes to read the user guide and after a day or so, I was comfortable with how everything felt. The menus and submenus seem to be grouped together logically. And you have to play around to figure out that you can press and hold or press and release the buttons. It ain't rocket science, it just takes a bit of getting used to.Some people have complained about the sound quality. HELLO!!! Let's put things into perspective. This great little MP3 player costs under $100. If you want audiophile quality, you have to listen to your music on your big expensive $25,000 home sound system. The earbuds that come with the player are low quality. No big deal. I just bought some Sony Fontopia earbuds and set the equalizer setting to Rock. This MP3 player now sounds as good as any MP3 player or iPod I've ever listened to. I can hear the treble and bass clearly and the subtle nuances in volume which the record producer wanted you to hear. And I don't hear any distortion. What more can you ask for?Some people complain that it's missing a neckstrap. Unlike the expensive iPod iAccessories, I bought my neckstrap at the Dollar Store. It cost me $1. Unlike the iPod, there are no other accessories to buy. It even comes with an armband and case for workouts.Some people complain there are no playlists. The solution is to use folders. The MP3 player plays all the music in 1 folder before going to the next. I have a folder with high energy music for workouts, another with mellow music for when I want to unwind and another 9 folders where I group music by artists alphabetically. So each folder could be considered a playlist. You really do need folders because if you don't use them, you could find yourself having to fast-forward or rewind 120 times to go from the beginning to the middle of the 240 tunes you loaded.Some people complain that there's no support for other file formats like OGG, ASF. There are a pile of freeware sound file format converters available. All you do is convert to MP3 or WMA format before transferring the file to your MP3 player. There might be a loss in audio quality, but I think only a highly trained audiophile will be able to detect it.Some people prefer an internal rechargeable battery. What are these people thinking????? Most batteries can only be charged about 300 times, then you have to scrap and replace your MP3 player (which costs $$$). And while you are recharging, you cannot use your MP3 player; recharging usually takes about 4 hours. And if you travel, you will have to bring your charger with you, and maybe a power converter too in countries which don't have 120V AC. If anything, you should complain about the exact opposite!!! If an MP3 player has a proprietary internal rechargeable battery, you should NOT buy it. Because it's money wasted, you'll have to replace it in 3 years when you cannot charge the battery. The battery life depends on the volume and the bit rate. According to the Apple batteries webpage, battery life also goes down if you use backlighting, or an equalizer setting or you fast forward. I play my music on level 26 - 30 (out of 40) and most of my music is 128 kbps MP3 format. I use my MP3 player 2 hours a day for my daily commute and maybe 1 hour on the weekends and a battery lasts me about a week. Why are people so worried about battery life? I always carry an extra AAA or 2 in my pocket and hardly notice the extra weight. It's not like I'm lugging a carton of milk around... I bought 4 900 mAh NiMH batteries and a charger for $15. 4 batteries x 300 charges per battery = 1,200 weeks of use = over 23 years for $15. Good for the environment, great for the wallet!Some people think that the MP3 player uses power when it's plugged into the computer. It doesn't, and you can prove this to yourself by removing the battery before plugging the MP3 player into your computer. And it still works... so it must be powered by the computer. It doesn't waste your battery power when you are loading up, it only uses power when you're listening to it or recording something.Some people complain about the lack of a direct USB connection. Not really an issue with me. A built in USB connector would just add an extra 1/2 inch to the length of the MP3 player without adding any real substantial benefit. And if my MP3 player was lost or stolen, I would want the other person to be stuck with my choice of tunes!!!Some people complain that it doesn't play loud enough. That's not really a bad thing because continued exposure to high volumes can permanently damage your hearing. I do most of my listening at level 26 - 30 (out of 40). When I just want music in the background, I lower it to about 20. And even Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix don't need more than level 33. And if I was hosting a block party, I wouldn't be using earbuds, I would plug the MP3 player into speakers and crank it up.Some people complain about the storage capacity. They get stuck at 550 Meg or 750 Meg? I formatted with the FAT32 file system. Right now I have 214 tunes totalling 848 Meg. I didn't use any music management software, just Windows Explorer. I didn't sync my music, just copy and paste from my computer to my MP3 player. I deliberately did not use all the capacity because I want to save some space for voice recordings.Some people site the new iPod's 15,000 song capacity. So what? I'm quite happy with my 240 tune capacity. I only have about 100 very favourite tunes on my ""A"" list anyway. The rest are on my ""B"" list which I change every now and then. I'm not going to load up my MP3 player with junk just to brag about its capacity. Because it would take that much more searching and scrolling through junk to find the tune I want to listen to. I find that on the average CD, there are only 2 or 3 great tunes, the rest are subpar tunes that I would not want to load onto my MP3 player anyway, that even if I did load them, I would not want to listen to them. Here's some simple math for you iPod users: 15,000 songs is over 1,200 CDs. 15,000 songs, at 3 minutes per song is about 750 hours of music. According to the Apple iPod site, your iPod battery can play 20 hours (if you don't use backlighting, if you don't use an equalizer setting, and if you don't fast forward) before you need to recharge. And you need to recharge 37 times (which would take more than 6 full days at 4 hours per charge) to listen to those 15,000 tunes. And you can only recharge most batteries about 300 times before you need to replace your iPod. That means you will have used up about 12% of your iPod's total lifespan just to listen to those 15,000 tunes once.Some people complain that the MP3 player looks fragile, especially the battery cover and the joystick. Hey, it's not a sparring partner. To keep costs low, to keep the MP3 player small and light, I guess there weren't too many choices in the design and building material.Some people complain about the MP3 player being broken when it gets dropped. When my MP3 player is hanging on my lanyard, it's about 3 1/2 feet from the ground. If my lanyard breaks and my MP3 player falls, it will probably break. But a lot of other things will break from a 3 1/2 foot drop, like my cell phone, my PDA, my digital camera, my non-digital camera, my VCR, my DVD player, my TV, my computer, my scanner, my printer, my toaster oven, my blender, etc. And I'm sure even my stove and refrigerator would break with a 3 1/2 foot drop. Why aren't you people complaining about all those other things being fragile too???Some people complain that the radio is staticky. Did they look to see if they are on the right frequency? It's only staticky on my player when I'm between radio stations. If I'm at the right frequency, it's crystal clear. Maybe the reception depends on where you live too. And I understand that if there is a lot of electrical interference in your environment, you will get static. But don't blame the MP3 player.People complain about 3 problems. They really should read their manuals.- Some people complain that it freezes up. They should check the sliding hold button. The only times my MP3 player freeze up is when I lock it up! When I first bought my MP3 player, I didn't always freeze it. I usually have it in my shirt pocket at work. Once I accidentally hit the start button, when I put on my earbuds after work, I found it was on, and I wasted a couple of hours of battery time. Now I always freeze it when I turn it off.- Some people complain about the dead silence between the tunes. It's because they have fade in turned on (Audio menu, Sound submenu (1st choice), 3rd function).- Some people complain there is no shuffle mode. Actually, there is (Audio menu, Repeat submenu (2nd choice), 2nd function).There are functions that are not available now. This MP3 player cannot record from the radio. It would also be nice if the MP3 player had 3D sound effects. Some people want to be able to delete a tune without having to connect to a computer. It doesn't bother me that much, if I delete a tune, there's space, so I should be connected to a computer to replace the deleted tune with another tune anyway. Why is it so important to be able to delete a tune directly on your MP3 player??? If you hated the tune that much... you shouldn't have loaded it to begin with!!! But all these things can be fixed. I hope the SanDisk engineers are reading these reviews. And I hope they will produce a new version of the firmware with more features. The good thing is that we can upgrade the firmware on the MP3 player, we are not forced to buy a new MP3 player just to enjoy the newer features. You could download everything you need from their site, user guides (if you lose your user guide), drivers, firmware, etc.And for all you Apple iPod nano users: I don't need any iAccessories, I just bought a lanyard for $1. I don't need a bulletproof cover on my MP3 player, and yet there are no scratches on it. I use backlighting, my equalizer is on, set to Rock and I fast forward and rewind to jump from tune to tune, folder to folder. And for a change of pace, I can listen to the built in radio. I can listen to my MP3 player non-stop. When a battery dies, I just put in a fresh one, I don't have to wait 4 hours for the thing to recharge. And I never have to worry about battery life, because this great MP3 player doesn't use proprietary rechargeable internal batteries, just good ol' 1.5 V AAAs. I always carry a spare battery or 2 and my $15 investment in a charger and 4 batteries will last me 23 years. And when I travel, I just have to make sure I buy a few extra packages of AAA batteries. Guess I'm not an iCult member.All in all, you are getting exceptional value for under $100, and I don't think most of the criticism is justified.

There are instances where I want to watch the same thing over and over. Music videos would be a good example of that. I liked using the old Apple TV's way of sorting music videos by type of music and using genius playlists. Speaking of music videos I want to point out that basically none of them are available in HD. This runs counter to Jobs claiming that everything on Apple TV is available in HD. It's not. Also if Apple ever wants to put out iOS on the Apple TV they would need a hard drive as you would need to store all  the apps and games and etc. All that being said I could see the appeal of this product for people who watch TV shows regularly but that just isn't me. I like to watch many things over and over again.UPDATE: Ugh why is it every time I review any Apple product with solid criticism my review attracts fan boys like flies? Look, fan boys, this isn't even a negative review of the product. You just didn't read my review. I said that this product would be great for some SOME people. In another words, yes, there is a portion of people out there who I think will really enjoy this product. But that is only SOME of the people, the people who watch lots of TV shows and movies might like this a lot.If you go back and actually read my review you will see that it specifically calls out music videos as content that doesn't even support 720p definition. This is a flaw because jobs said that ALL the content is available in HD (which in this case means 720p.) In reality videos don't even look good on a 20"" computer monitor. That is a lot less then 720p that jobs claims.No this Apple TV does not support iOS apps and iOS games. This is understandable at this point because Apple is currently involved in so many different iOS projects that trying to take on iOS app support would be too ambitious. This year they already released a major OS upgrade, an entirely new piece of hardware (iPad) and two evolutionary updates (iPod and iPhone.) It simply would be too much work to add app support to Apple TV in the same year. So that wasn't a criticism I was just starting a fact.Also the problem with this product for SOME, SOME people is this you can't take it with anywhere without an internet connection. Where is work I am responsible for putting together a slideshow for the various trade shows that we do. If I can't save photos to the device then I can't do the slideshow. Therefore for me this wouldn't be the best product but for SOME other people it might be just fine.After a long discussion with people in the comments section it occurred to me that this product was way worse then I realized and I therefore have had to lower the rating from my original three star review.The problems that I didn't realize from my original review are as follows:1. The product requires an iOS device. This means that:2. The device is no longer $99 but a minimum of $329. Which would only get you3. Minimum storage (iPod base model is 8gb)4. If you wanted 64gb of storage from an is iOS you would have to spend $530.5. However the device may already be filled up with lots of music giving you very little storage to for HD video.6. The iOS device would run out of electricity eventually.7. What if I want to use the iOS device for something other then streaming the video? Maybe over people want to watch something but I need to use the iOS for something. I can't because it is already tied up in streaming.8. What if WiFi isn't available where I am at?9. What if the TV isn't available where I am at?10. There is the option of having to drag a laptop with you everywhere along with the Apple TV. The problem for me is that I have no use for a laptop at all. This poses the question why would I have to buy the laptop when all I need is the storage?Why don't they just make this product available 8, 32, and 64 gig versions like with the iPod? If they did this I wouldn't need to:1. Drag around extra products.2. Spend money on extra products that I may not over wise even need to have.3. Would never run out of electricity.4. Can walk around with your iOS device without having to worry about it being in range of streaming with the device.5. Would not have to fill my device up with HD content.Apple needs to make a product that delivers the strength of the ATV1 and the ATV2. I also give Apple a huge mark down for breaking the syncing capabilities of the ATV1 with iTunes 10. As of iTunes 10 there is no longer any way to sync content with the ATV1. The forums on Apple's website are full of people complaining about this.I would like to close my review with a great point that I read from Macworld that I think perfectly sums up it's short coming:reasonable people will continue to chafe at the limited nature of the Apple TV. For example, even though syncing could be a problem with the original Apple TV, at least it--coupled with the Apple TV's hard drive--made it possible for you to enjoy your media without the need for an alive and awake computer. Now that the Apple TV has no hard drive, you must leave your Mac running and iTunes open if you want access to your music and movies. As long as the Apple TV doesn't support some kind of storage--attached via USB, more internal flash memory, and/or network-attached storage (NAS)--it remains a solution that requires one device too many when playing local media.Well said","09 19, 2010",A29HEP4USHKWM8,Kendall L.

Hope this is not a trend.  I am now using this lens mainly in dust free in-door environments and my Canon 24-70 F/2.8 which is sealed for outdoor dusty areas.I just got this fantastic low light lens last week.  Will be adding more comments as time permits.This lens has quickly become one of my most used lens. It's the lens I would choose if I could just choose one to shoot a wedding with and I'm free to approach the bride and groom during any part of the ceremony. It's also THE one lens I would choose to take on a vacation, it's that versatile. I love the part where I can walk into a dark cathedral and hand hold a shot at 1 second and it's razor sharp. What a lens!!!Pros:Sharp even at F/2.8No internal dust so farGreat zoom ring location and sizeVery pleasing shots with nice BokahAuto focus perfect!  Silent quick lock even in dim conditionsImage Stabilization let's you get those shots you couldn't get otherwise.Auto Lens Vignetting correction using peripheral Illumination control see Auto Vignetting comments below:Cons:Cheap plastic constructionNo dust yet but I am concernedSome Chromatic Aberration (CA) at 17mmNo included lens hood? Give me a break Canon!Really poor zoom feel grabs between 23 and 35mmFront of lens extends inward and outward when zooming in and outI bought this lens to take low light portraits during weddings.  My initial impression is that this lens will be perfect.  I even managed to pull off a 2 second exposure that was pretty sharp hand held which I would never be able to do otherwise.  I will use it at the extreme in 55mm for nice bokah and a softer shot then keep it between 20mm to 48mm for the sharper shots.What a disappointment to pay over $1,000 for a lens and have such a poor feeling zoom.  It grabs at each end and just plain feels cheap.  Makes my Canon 17-40 F4 L lens zoom feel like it's perfect as it is silky smooth. But, the 17-55 F/2.8 IS does something I could not do with the 17-40.  I was at a bar the other night shooting a benefit auction using just available bar light and already at 1600 ISO and the Canon 17-40 wide open just could not get the shot.  With the 17-55 F/2.8 IS not only do you have the faster aperture F/2.8 but I can get shot after hand held shot at a half a second something I could not come close to with the 17-40.All in all though except for the zoom and construction this lens really does rock when you look at the photos.  Between 20mm and 40mm it is sharper then the 17-40 at any comparable F stop.  So don't let my cons keep you from getting this lens.  If you need low light shots in the 17-55 range this is your only option in a zoom.  It's a shame that Canon does not offer an L lens that's 17-55 F/2.8 with IS.  I would have gladly paid $1500 for an L lens.  In the long lens range there are tons of choices from Canon that are L lens.  It's true what they say Canon owns the long lens but come up a little short with the wide anglesI do my first wedding next Saturday with this lens, time will tell if it's a keeper.  Will post updates in the coming weeks.3-25-2008 UpdateWhat a great lens, after reviewing wedding photos yesterday with my clients I have to agree the photos just pop in color and the sharpness is crazy with this lens between 20 and 50mm even wide open which is what I shot most of the time.  The bokeh though not as good as my Canon 85mm F/1.2 and Canon 135mm F2 is still pleasing and unlike the two primes I can stand in one place during the wedding and zoom in and out for different points of view.What ever you do don't even confuse this F/2.8 IS lens with the basic kit lens.  It is truly except for the lack of weather sealing and poor zoom feel an L lens in photo quality!4-8-2008 UpdateStill no dust thank God!  I am taking it to a local park to photograph our company party this weekend and it's very dusty there.  Should be a good chance to see if the lens is going to be a dust hog or not.  The zoom even seems to breaking in a little and is now just a little smoother, nothing like my L lens zooms but better then when new.  Still loving this lens and in fact if I had to choose just one lens to do a wedding this would of course be it, it's the most versatile and easiest to use by far!5-21-2008 UpdateStill NOT one single spec of dust in this lens.  I have been using outdoor at the park and on outdoor weddings the last 5 weekends in a row and not a single spec of dust despite being in extremely dusty Mesa Arizona.  I am constantly amazed at what this lens can get away with in low light.  We were shooting the reception to an outdoor wedding well after sundown and I was hanging in there with my Canon 40D and a 85mm F/1.2 L II at 3200 ISO shooting close ups.  My daughter was shooting at the same time covering the wide angle photo ops with this Canon 17-55 F/2.8 IS and was getting shots here and there at 1600 ISO with her Rebel of the crowd as long as people were still even up to the point of a full second exposure.  This was well after it was too dark to be taking photos without flash but we were still getting photos (we hate flash too unflattering and flat) Simply AMAZING!6-30-2008 UpdateThis lens still has not a spec of dust!  And it has become one of my most used lens.  It's the lens I would choose if I could just choose one to shoot a wedding with and I'm free to approach the bride and groom during any part of the ceremony.  It's also THE one lens I would choose to take on a vacation, it's that versatile.  I love the part where I can walk into a dark cathedral and hand hold a shot at 1 second and it's razor sharp.  What a lens!!!9-5-2008 UpdateThis is by far and away my most used lens now.  It's the lens that stays on my Canon 40D 90% of the time.  I just went with my wife to the Arizona Museum of Natural History and wanted to take photos inside without using flash.  I love that natural look and hate the flatness of flash.  I shot almost the entire museum at F/2.8 and ISO 800 sometimes ISO 400 without a monopod or tripod.  That's something I could not have done with my Canon 24-70 F/2.8.  As a plus the 17-55 EF-S IS F/2.8 lens is much lighter then my 24-70.  If it feels like I am gushing over this lens it's because I am.  And it's a dead spot in Canon's lineup.  As of this writing they don't have a single wide angle L lens with Image Stabilization and that's a crying shame.  Also I tried shooting some fireworks this weekend WITHOUT a tripod!!  I managed up to 3 seconds exposure by leaning against a light pole and got some decent shots.  Again without the IS there is no way you could get such shots.  My only regret is that I didn't get this lens earlier Oh and it would be nice if it was sealed, but I still have not a single spec of dust on the inside!!9-12-2008 Update Canon EF-S 17-55 F/2.8 IS vs Canon 24-70 F/2.8 L:I am taking photos tonight of a stage special and again will need to use both my Canon 17-55 F/2.8 IS lens and my Canon 24-70 F/2.8 L lens since my daughter and I will be shooting at the same time.  I can't help comparing the two again.  The 17-55 feels much lighter but at the same time feels so much cheaper in the hand between the cheap plastic feel the grabbing in the center of the zoom and the plastic build.  The 24-70 feels like a heavy quality jewel that will last two life times or more and it's weather sealed.  Still if you have to carry the 24-70 around for a few hours you wish for the lighter weight of the 17-55. The 17-55 has a wider view but the 24-70 has more reach.  The 17-55 seems sharper throughout the range but seems to have just a little less contrast and slightly cooler colors then the 24-70.  The zoom on my 24-70 is now almost broken in and feels smooth as silk and totally professional the 17-55 zoom feels like a cheap plastic toy.  The 17-55 has image stabilization and the 24-70 does not so I end up using a monopod for most dark shots with the 24-70.  The 17-55 is an EF-S and will not fit a full frame camera, the 24-70 will.  I'm thinking forward to the future  when I will be adding a full frame Canon camera body to my collection and I think the 24-70 will be perfect on that camera.9-16-2008 Update:I've noticed this lens has some Chromatic Aberration (CA) at 17mm.  When in a clean room taking photos of semi-conductor manufacturing equipment you have to zoom wide to get everything in the photo and that's when I noticed this lens especially under fluorescent lighting taking photos of highly reflect surfaces has a problem.  So much so that I retook the photos with my Canon 17-40 F/4 L lens and was astounded at how much better the photos looked.  Normally my 17-55 F/2.8 IS looks better then the 17-40 but in this case with macro and up close mechanical photos zoomed out to 17 the 17-40 really looked much better.  When out shooting landscapes in daylight this has never been a problem with the 17-55 IS F/2.8.  So take note if you take macro shots at 17mm under fluorescent lights you may want a different lens.  Otherwise the 17-55 F/2.8 IS is an absolute stunner!!!11-3-2008 Update:I now have a single spec of dust inside the corner of this lens under the front element.Auto Vignetting peripheral illumination control:Canon has this super sweet Auto Lens Vignetting correction that works with this lens both in camera with JPEG's and in RAW using peripheral Illumination control in Canon Digital Photo Professional (DPP) when using newer Canon digital EOS cameras (Canon Rebel XSi, 40D, 5D Mark II etc.) .  No more vignetting when shooting wide open!!!  When shooting Raw open the file(s) in DPP and click on NR/Lens Lens Aberration Correction / Tune and click on Peripheral illumination.  The cameras listed above have already picked up the amount of vignetting based on focusing distance, zoom setting and F stop from the lens and the camera has saved the information with the Raw file.  You can then adjust the amount under Peripheral Illumination if you don't like the amount automatically suggested.  If you shot JPEG then you get the auto amount.  SWEET!!!Conclusion:  In the end I will just have to keep both of them.Canon EF-S 17-55 F/2.8 IS Ultra sharp, great colors, great low light, poor zoom actionCanon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Rebel XTi Kit lens Muddy, slow, pile of junkCanon EF 17-40mm f/4 L Fantastic colors, sharp zoomed 17 to 24mm, ultra smooth zoom action, light weightCanon EF 24-70mm f/2.8 L Fantastic colors and contrast, sharp zoomed 40 to 70mm, zoom a little stiff at first, heavy, repair prone!Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Good budget portrait lens, light weight, disposable, sharp from F/2.5Canon EF 85mm F/1.2 L II The best portrait lens for female and children clients, buttery smooth Bokeh, heavy and expensive it shares sharpness with 135mmCanon EF 135mm F/2.0 L The best portrait lens for males and tied with Canon 85mm F 1/.2 for sharpest lens I own, buttery smooth BokehCanon EF 70-200mm f/2.8 L fantastic colors, sharp for a zoom, very versatile ego boosting and attention getting and heavy!

In general, small cameras must sacrifice picture quality for convenience; most professional grade cameras must sacrifice portability.  I chose the RX-100- II as a possible compromise, choosing portability with the expectation that I would have the camera with me more often, and because of the relatively large sensor the photo quality would satisfy for most purposes. After about a month of use, I find the camera is slightly less portable than I thought.  At the same time the picture quality far exceeds my expectations.On the portability - it's a small point, but that was the rationale for getting a compact - it is just big and heavy enough to be awkward in my jeans pockets.  If the pocket is loose enough, like a jacket pocket, there is no problem, even if the power button is accidentally pushed and the lens extends.  But in my pants pockets, it's a squeeze getting the camera in and out, and if the lens extends when you reach in for the camera, extracting becomes a major operation.  After trying the pocket route for several weeks, I decided to purchase the beautiful Sony camera case that comes with a shoulder strap.  This is more convenient than digging the camera out of your pocket, although the camera is less concealed, but having the option works well for different shooting situations.The picture quality is much better than I expected. The main reason I chose this camera is the sensor size, which is among the largest of any compact camera.  Unsurprisingly, in my test comparisons of the same shot, it beat hell out of my older point and shoot, but I didn't expect it to run circles around my 5-year old Olympus DSLR.  SLRs are supposed to give better results than compacts, period.  Apparently not so.  Except for rare situations where an extended telephoto is needed, if picture quality is essential, there is no good reason for me NOT to use the Sony.  The resolution, color rendition, relatively low noise even at 1600 ISO and above, low light capability with its f1.8 lens, all this in addition to the extensive control features -- this is one terrific package.Some of the disadvantages (I've listed them below) were inherent in the design of a compact, so I don't downgrade it for being what it is.  I haven't tried all the features yet, including video, but overall for two main reasons so far I give this the highest rating:  1) The picture quality exceeds my expectations. I was planning to invest in a full-frame DSLR as well, but for my purposes, after seeing what this camera can do, I'm not sure I'll bother.  In the long run, this may offset the disadvantage of camera's expensive price; 2) There is virtually unlimited control if you want it, as much or more than most DSLRs.  But the two automatic modes quickly and accurately determine ideal settings if you're in a hurry or if you just prefer to leave decisions up to the camera.  In summary:The good:* compact - fits in jacket pocket or fanny pack, a bit of a squeeze for jeans, but beats an SLR for travel.* rugged construction, heavy weight (even though aluminum), doesn't feel cheap* Modest appearance for security: doesn't call attention to itself as an ""expensive"" camera.* fold down 3"" LED screen - good for shading and angle shots.  - an upgrade from the earlier model RX-100 which does not fold out, and well worth the extra expense.* Superior quality photos for any camera, particularly a compact: -- considerably sharper, less noise and better color rendition than my SLR.* large sensor for a compact: close to 4/3 size* Good dynamic range:  ISO to 1600 with virtually no noise, higher when needed.* Fast lens: f1.8 max aperture (f4.9 at telephoto position). Great for low light situations.* Good resolution at 20 mp (RAW image), 6-8mp (.jpg).* sharp lens* Excellent macro position - as close as 2""* RAW capabilities (.arw) - see below* Flexible arrangement of dials and buttons, most are programmable to user's choice, a huge plus  (i.e., traditional ""focus"" ring can be used for manual focus, exposure compensation, ISO, aperture, shutter speed, etc.)* Lens cover closes when lens retracts - provides lens protection without having to place and remove cap.  A major convenience in my view.* Menu intuitive and extensive.* Good battery life.The bad:* No viewfinder -Difficult or impossible to compose shots in bright sun. This is a big sacrifice, but necessary for compactness.* Expensive for a compact, and expensive accessories (i.e.,case = $70)* Small size awkward to manipulate if you're used to full-size SLR.* Zoom only 3X telephoto, not extensive.* RAW files are proprietary Sony .arw - requires conversion to .dng for Lightroom 4, i.e., a slight inconvenience.* WI-FI doesn't connect to my iMac. Others have reported this problem.  I'm using Eye-FI instead, but the USB cable is fast and easy enough.  I haven't tried the NFC and probably won't have much use for it.* No GPS, but Eye-Fi memory card (optional) has WPS.* Some edge distortion at the extreme wide-angle position. Wide angle a good feature, but can be a problem with portraits -- may need to back up and use higher focal length to avoid distortion.* Slippery surfaces with no grip - danger of dropping, despite wrist strap.  Recommend grip accessory or Sony camera case (not included).* Sensitive power switch on top of camera, can activate when handling, i.e., when camera is in your pocket, extending the lens making it difficult to remove.*  No external battery charger included.  Recommend purchase inexpensive 3rd party charger with extra batteries, which works fine.EDIT:  I am about half way through ""Photographer's Guide to the Sony DSC-RX100-II""  by Alexander S. White. Highly recommended if you want to learn the many outstanding, interesting, and fun features of this amazing camera. Did you know that in some modes the camera will take multiple shots and combine them to produce an image with less noise and camera shake in low light?  Who knew that dramatic panorama shots were so easy to take without a tripod?  Far from a crutch to avoid manual settings, the Scene modes are varied and great time savers.  Memory Recall mode, so you can program often-used settings that can be retrieved in an instant.  You probably won't use most of the features, but if you are serious about your picture taking, it will benefit you to know what this camera is capable of! There is no way you can learn all this intuitively.

Let's assume it's the latter and get to the really interesting stuff.This camera is in a class of one.  There's really nothing like it anywhere in the marketplace.  It's absurdly expensive for a point-and-shoot, and yet it takes pictures that rival in overall image quality - and in many cases equal or even exceed - what the very best full frame professional cameras are capable of generating . . . . .  while fitting fairly comfortably in your jacket pocket.  It looks like your neighbor's point-and-shoot $350 Canon, but costs more than your last vacation.  It doesn't even have a viewfinder, either optical or electronic - although you can get a great electronic one, if you don't mind being soaked for another $450 on top of what you've already shelled out for this expensive but marvelous piece of technology.  Or you can get really hosed by Zeiss, and get an optical viewfinder for another $650 - easily the most overpriced accessory in digital photography.  It isn't the fastest focusing, and it requires you to move closer or farther to get the shot that you want instead of zooming in or out given the fixed focal length lens.  It can be both maddening to struggle with under the wrong circumstances . . .  and at the same time a breeze to use like any other point-and-shoot.  It seems wildly overpriced in some sense (compared to any other compact?), but is a genuine bargain in terms of what you are getting (best current 35mm 2.0 lens, best 24MP FF sensor in tiny package with highly customizable operating system).It's like nothing else really.  Its high ISO performance is equal to anything and I do mean anything out there.  It's capable of taking low noise images at ISO 6400, and with a little bit of cleanup and working in RAW, you can easily salvage fairly high quality pictures at ISO 12,800 with lots of detail and little loss of information due to noise.  This competes with some of the most expensive FF models in terms of low light ability (the Canon 1Dx, 6D, 5DIII, Nikon D4 and D600 - at worst, it is very close to those benchmark systems in terms of low light ability - at best it is equal to any of them).Overall, the camera is something of a walking contradiction in terms in many ways (a full frame compact), and at the same time, it's a camera that's capable of inspiring enormous loyalty and will likely generate a truly cult-like following, while many other people may simply shake their heads at what they see as Sony's foolishness. People will complain about the cost, but it's really a good value and you get what you pay for.Pros:1) Remarkable compactness and portability for such enormous low light capabilities w/full frame sensor - an engineering tour de force in terms of cramming full frame capabilities into a point-and-shoot size and form factor (achievable only with a fixed lens).2) Capable of remarkable detail due to its 24 megapixel full frame sensor with excellent color and dynamic range.  DxO sensor score of 93 (4th highest of any tested camera including some medium format sensors).3) Superb Carl Zeiss 35mm F 2.0 fixed lens that is sharp edge-to-edge (which for FF camera might cost $1200 or so by itself). (F4-f8 offers sharpest pictures edge to edge but f2 is still impressive).  Highest rated 35mm lens available by DxO testing.4) As good high ISO as virtually any full frame camera.5) Intuitive but deep operating system and menu structures, immediately familiar to those coming from Sony Alpha background.  Easy to run as full manual camera (excellent manual control dials for exposure, lens aperture, etc) . . . or put on full AUTO, and all shades in between.  Good aperture priority mode operation (my personal fav).6) Capable of shooting 1080 at 60p and taking good video in low light, and with full IS (image stabilization) but see cons.7) Macro functionality in CZ lens (but see cons). Macro mode works well with built-in flash (not always the case suggesting they paid attention to this issue).8) Customizable buttons and other nice user config operating system features.9) Crop/zoom functionality of x1.4 and x2.0 partially mitigates fixed lens restrictions (equivalent to 50 and 70 mm lens but with obvious loss of resolution).10) High build quality w/ nice magnesium chassis - has very solid feel (it ought to for this much $!).11) Decent flash.12) Nice JPEGs vs. the competition - Sony's stay fairly sharp to 3200 at least, while Nikon and (to a much lesser extent) Canon default JPEGs are losing detail at those ISOs.  Adjustable NR on high ISO images in JPEG - setting to LOW can help to preserve details.13) ISO scale goes all the way down to 50 and all the way up to 25,600 (ISO 50 is useful in bright light to get super clean noise free images).14) More standard ISO hot shoe (but see cons) - can be adapted to older Sony flashes with neat accessory from Sony.  Older flashes then work flawlessly.15) Many excellent shooting modes, including fascinating watercolor and illustration modes for some really amazing posters (part of Sony's firmware).16) Much better than average AUTO WB.  With most cameras, leaving WB on auto is invitation to some funky pictures.  Sony is able to get this close to 'spot on' more than almost anybody in their recent operating systems.17) Noise at high ISO is really almost film-like.Cons:1) Price. Decent value for the money, but still costly.2) Fixed focal length lens means extra work to get the shot properly framed - and forget about shooting subjects at a distance.3) Problems with focus lock in low light - mostly a standard contrast detection focus issue (but for example OM5 does better job). Fixable in firmware updates?  Can take a long time to acquire focus, missing key moments. Slow focus even in good light.4) Blinding auto-focus assist lamp.  At nighttime light levels, where autofocus really struggles, almost as bad as flash.  Without it (can be defeated), forget about focus in low light. Problems 3/4 underscore that Sony hasn't really figured out contrast detection autofocus on this sensor.5) Possibility of semi-planned obsolescence, as Sony may release a zoom lens version sometime in the next year or two (would require another set of engineering breakthroughs to get FF zoom lens down in size).6) Disappointing that Sony did not include an electronic viewfinder as either standard equipment at this price, or at a discount.7) Macro mode won't get closer than about 8 inches.8) No IS for stills - given that this is always sensor-based in Sony systems, not sure why omitted (hi ISO performance plus 35mm focal length?). Would still potentially give two stops advantage - not trivial even with great ISO performance.9) Sony STILL hasn't made viewing photos and videos in any kind of alternating fashion easy - must surf menus or shoot video to get easy viewing access to videos on card.10) Poor battery life.  Must carry two batteries for any extended shooting.11) Lens zoom and crop functionality not available if shooting in RAW.12) Flash has really quite modest output and no bounce functionality.13) Can't use both optional viewfinder and external flash at the same time.14) Poor thumb grip with not enough contour - not easy to hold onto the camera with one hand.  Optional thumb grip goes for $250?15) Charging only in-camera, and only with proprietary micro USB interface - can't charge with typical USB charger (if connected to computer that is on and camera detects an active data line). What is the logic of that?  Absolutely bizarre.16) Accessories cost?  $250 for a decent case?  $250 for better (add-on) thumb grip? $650 for a simple OPTICAL viewfinder - you're kidding right?17) Disappointing video quality with both moire and fuzziness (shouldn't have both?) despite impressive specs - realistically lucky if you get 720 lines or so, and with again at best average focus lock.  Video is passable overall w/ excellent color but still disappointing in FF camera where one expects better.18) Auto compensation for vignetting (corner shading) introduces subtle color artifacts.  Baked in to RAW files too, not just JPEG - but this auto correction can be turned off in menu (probably easily fixable in firmware updates?).Having more cons than pros doesn't mean that I don't like/love this camera.  I'm a bit stunned by its capabilities on the one hand, and frustrated with its limitations and very quirky design logic on the other (such as the bizarre charging limitations!?*&^%! that prevent charging with most micro-USB chargers).  On balance, it's obvious that what makes it so remarkable actually locks in some of its limitations.  You simply couldn't get this compact form factor with an EVF and even a 3x zoom lens.  The lens alone would be huge, and this Zeiss lens itself is an engineering marvel, in terms of how small it really is for a FF sensor 2.0 lens.  In the end, it's all about image quality, and here, at least in stills if not in video (which is a bit disappointing frankly - like the A99 video), there is little to complain about.  One also wonders how much the somewhat fuzzy video could be fixed in future firmware - it would appear that the A99 has been saddled with the same weakness, suggesting that Sony hasn't figured out how to get the best video out of this new chip at least not yet.  But if you take this pocketable wonder instead of your huge DSLR and bag of lenses, just because it's so damned convenient, isn't that in the end the strongest endorsement one can make?  I find that I am transitioning away from a very favorite Sony A65 w/a very fine 16-50 2.8 as my default camera, just because this is so easy to carry, and makes the DSLT seem huge and bulky by comparison.I'm still exploring the performance envelope of the RX-1, and will update this review as I go.  Some have commented that this is a Leica 'wannabe'.  But Leica would LOVE to have the image quality of this camera (not really all that close frankly, not even the M9 which was way better than the X1), so perhaps it's really the other way around.  It's a remarkable camera by any standard, and perhaps the most INTERESTING/INTRIGUING camera that has been made in the last 10 years, with the possible exception of the new SLTs made also by Sony.  Suggests that Sony is thinking outside the box, and doing so more creatively than anyone else. 4.5 out of 5 stars - but Amazon doesn't allow such a rating so settling for 4/5.  If they had fixed the (lack of) external charger situation, and provided a cheaper EVF option at purchase, would easily give 5/5.UPDATE April 4th, 2013This camera continues to grow on me.  Its upside is pretty amazing.  I have been able to print out 19x13 prints from ISO 3200 images, and have them be sharp, detailed and with excellent color - something I would have thought impossible two years ago. On the other hand, I am still at times frustrated with the poor focus lock, but am finding ways to work around it.  Have gotten two extra batteries with an external charger to obviate the craziness of the USB charging (Wasabi power - highly recommended for $16) and the EVF, which really makes shooting stills a lot easier.  Pictures are often just superb, even just stock JPEGs.  Most of the time run with high ISO NR set to low, and sharpness at +2 - wouldn't want to do that with a Canon, but with the default JPEGs being rather over-smooth to begin with, this gets the most detail out of the sensor without any sharpness artifacts that I have been able to find so far.  RAW images can be turned into decent large size prints with some work up to ISO 12800 - also something I would have thought impossible several years ago.  I also believe that the default JPEG settings (overly smoothed) are probably a function of Sony compensating for the relatively weak anti-aliasing (otherwise known as a low pass filter).  More and more camera makers are weakening that or leaving it out altogether (like the Nikon D800E and new 7100) chasing the consumer's endless demand for sharpness and resolution.  In any case, I haven't seen any increase in aliasing or moire artifacts at the 2+ sharpening - but don't use for portraits of your wife or girlfriend or they won't be posing for you much longer :-).Movies are still a minor disappointment in terms of resolution, but color and dynamic range are excellent so I am living with the roughly 720p instead of the 1080p I thought I was getting.  Hoping that some of the camera's quirks can be fixed or at least improved with firmware updates - although after consultation with Tim Naff (see his superb review of the A99 on Amazon) I suspect that a simple firmware re-write probably won't be able to fix the fuzzy video, as the problems may lie deeper in Sony's processing of video, as the same video is seen on the A99, and milder versions of the video issues are seen on other product lines.  A real puzzle given Sony's broadcast video resume, which is among the best.Surprised at least a bit that Sony hasn't released firmware 1.1.  I suspect they are probably busy with all the change items.  There have been several blogs devoted to the wish-list for the 1.1 firmware re-write.  Curious how much Sony has been listening.  They know they have a huge hit on their hands.  This camera is going to be a classic. I love the images that it is capable of making if you know how to max out its performance, and it is just so much more convenient than the big 20+ lb bag for the DSLR and three lenses.  It's a keeper.Update June 2013Still no news on the firmware update front.  However Sony did release the RX-1R which drops the anti-aliasing (AA) filter - consistent with an increasing trend in the marketplace to push resolution as much as possible and successful (from a marketing standpoint and sales standpoint anyway) in relationship to the Nikon D800E, and the recently released Nikon 7100, along with several other cameras including a couple of new Pentax models where the AA filter has been removed.  Otherwise the cameras are identical, and after looking at moir&eacute; vulnerability of the new RX-1R, I think the plain ordinary RX-1 with the AA filter is the smarter choice for almost everybody except for studio photographers or people shooting exclusively nature scenes where small fine repeating patterns rarely exist.  In all honesty, I can't really see that much extra resolution from the RX-1R, as the AA filter was rather weak to begin with (at least IMO) in the original RX-1.  In any case, the camera continues to hum along, working flawlessly and continuing to create superb stills both in JPEG and RAW, except for some problems with lowlight autofocus that I've learned to live with.  It works also superbly with an older Sony flash unit HVL-F42AM which gives it excellent bounce flash.  And unlike on the Sony A65, flash is NEVER overexposed.  The one significant limitation of the camera is the lack of any real capacity to shoot anything at a distance, but for 95% of the shooting that I do, moderate wide-angle along with the 1.4 crop (which yields about a 50 mm view) is adequate.  And for when I need really wide-angle, composite stitching of images also works just fine, even without using Sony's panorama mode which sacrifices too much resolution.  HIGHLY recommended - if you can live with the camera's few major limitations (fixed lens and weak focus lock being the two biggies).Update October 2013Well things have gotten a whole lot more interesting . . . Sony has blown everyone out of the water with the announcement of the A7 and A7R (please don't call them NEX cameras as this will upset Sony's cachet/rebranding strategy) but let's face it, that's what they are, souped-up NEX cameras.  However, on paper, they simply are leagues ahead of anything else at this form factor in terms of potential performance, with the really interesting one being the A7R with its 36 megapixel sensor without an anti-aliasing filter - clearly the basic sensor from the Nikon D800E (which only the hard-core Nikon fan boys ever denied was a Sony sensor).  The reality is that the A7/7R competes with the Sony RX 1 directly, and may have been Sony's notion of how the upgrade path would work for that camera all along.  It's about the same weight, and about the same size even, as long as you have the smaller 35mm lens on the A7, with the same sensor in the A7, and a very similar operating system albeit with a different shutter (way louder on the A7 unfortunately) and better autofocus on the AR7.  The A7 and of course the A7R obviously will have a big advantage that the RX 1 of course can't claim - the option for multiple lenses.  The really interesting one of the proposed 5 new full frame FE lenses is the Zeiss 24-70 F4, which is priced at $1200 (prior generation NEX E lenses are not full frame and will result in severe vignetting unless you select significant image cropping).  The biggest problem with the NEX series was simply mediocre lenses unless you are willing to spend a boatload to get a Zeiss lens, and some believe that even the Zeiss lenses in the E mount system were a step down from their A mount lenses (but I haven't seen enough hard testing data to draw a conclusion on that).  Because of all this, I believe that the Zeiss 24-70 needs to be a virtual homerun in terms of its performance for this system really to take off.  If it is as good as the Alpha mount 24-70 2.8 (a monster lens BTW in terms of both size and price), the A7/7R becomes a viable alternative to the RX 1 and begins to look like a compact pro camera.  I haven't actually shot yet with either model and I'm looking forward to getting my hands on an early release model to really evaluate it.  A major question is whether they have done something to improve the video quality, which was not bad but not great on the alpha 99/RX 1.Here's my parsing of pros and cons of the RX-1 against the new AR7/7R.Pluses of the AR7-7R versus RX-11) interchangeable lenses - far and away its biggest selling point and advantage.2) included OLED electronic viewfinder (extra cost upgrade option on the RX-1).3) slightly cheaper identically equipped (AR7 with 35mm 2.8) $2500 versus $3200 for the RX-1 with Sony's add-on EVF.4) improved auto focus system relative to RX-1 with phase detection on sensor (but A7R stuck with just contrast detection after deleting AA filter).5) significantly better accessory support including a nice battery grip - Sony appears to be positioning this as a viable professional camera and not just something for photography enthusiasts with money to spend.6) significant resolution bump for A7R with identical sensor to Nikon D800E - making it a potential alternative to medium format in a way-smaller form factor (but watch out for moir&eacute; if you're not shooting exclusively natural scenes). Having that much resolution in this little a package is really a bullet point for Sony.7) No firmware update for the RX-1 in over a year since release!  Does this mean that Sony has already orphaned this fantastic camera, with all their attention on the A7/7r?Pluses of the RX-1 versus the AR7-7R1) a true coat pocket camera versus I don't know what kind of pocket for the AR7?  Without taking the lens off no AR7 is going to fit in even a generous coat pocket (unless it has the 35mm 2.8 which puts it close in size to the RX-1).  But with the 24-70 f4 Zeiss, forget about any pocketability.  Removing lenses frequently obviously exposes the sensor to dust and other potential environmental negatives.2) questionable and frankly disappointing lens systems for NEX camera group up to now means a bit of an uphill push for Sony to get the new FE lenses up to alpha Zeiss/G lens standards. (UPDATE: Testing on the first of the FE full frame Zeiss lenses suggests that the 55m 1.8 lens is exceptionally sharp!)3) even roughly identically equipped, the RX-1 has a faster lens (2.0 versus 2.8). In any case, the lens on the RX-1 is by any measure a screaming homerun and might be the best 35mm lens anyone has made up to this point.4) lighter weight for the RX-1.5) nice little flash on the RX-1, nothing on the AR7-7R. A dedicated flash is going to really add bulk. This is one of my biggest concerns about the A7/7r - I find that the flash on the RX-1 really comes in handy, and provides very consistent exposures.  I have an older Sony HVL-F42AM which I love for bounce flash, but it is large and bulky.6) UPDATE!! - big problems with sensor reflections (or some other type of artifacts) are emerging in the early reviews of the A7, in relation to bright light sources.  See discussion of this on DPReviews Sony Users blog, where you can also find some striking examples of this - other cameras have demonstrated these types of artifacts from time to time, but the A7 and even the A7r show major problems (streetlights, other bright light sources, esp. sun - and this is NOT simple lens flare, which is universal at least to some degree).  In addition, both the A7 and A7r show more dramatic 'sun-star' artifacts than most cameras show.  THESE ARE A BIG DOWNSIDE (at least IMHO)!!  Sony is doing their usual damage control - minimizing, denying, and basically just hoping that the negative press dies out.  Not sure I would buy one of these camaras - as great as they are - until Sony fixes this issue.  If you shoot a lot a night with street scenes and various artificial lights, the sensor reflections on the A7/7r are going to be a potentially major distraction.  Troubling that Sony didn't pick up on this and fix it. On the other hand, early testing suggests that the Zeiss FE lenses (35 2.8, 55 1.8 and 24-70 F4) are just fabulous and every bit as good as the Zeiss lens on the RX-1.  These will allow the A7r to really exploit that fantastic sensor.So aside from the usual trade-offs here of lowered weight and portability versus operational flexibility, lens and other support ecosystem options, what separates the RX-1 from the A7/7r?  Not much.  The interesting thing here is that Sony is clearly going to be competing with themselves given that no one else, well almost no one else excepting Leica whose products are simply out of reach, is making a full frame relatively compact ILC.  It's a real throwdown to the rest of the ILC world and looks positioned to capture most of the high-end of the ILC market. Will be interesting to see what the marketplace does with this.Meanwhile back at the RX-1 ranch, I have to conclude that not even Sony (with the new A7/A7r) can beat the portability of the full frame RX-1 - and neither can anyone else.  My overall conclusion is that if you can live with the limitations of a fixed lens, there is still nothing out there close to this camera right now.","02 6, 2013",A2MVF3CEV2DZQL,"D. F.

Image quality is very good and the camera is enjoyable to use. That being said, my X100s has been treated extremely gently, the lens cover is mostly left on until ready to shoot, and it has been mostly used indoors. So the other night I was somewhat surprised to notice several significant spots on the lens which I then carefully and gently tried to clean away. Quickly realized the four metallic looking spots of various sizes were not on the surface of the lens but apparently are on the back of the lens and probably is the lens coating flaking off. Spoke to Fujifilm Tech Support who claimed they never heard of this issue although I found it mentioned online (Google 'X100s lens coating flaking'). Sent it off to Fujifilm Repair Service in Edison NJ this past Friday and am awaiting their explanation. Very disappointing, to say the least... Honestly I am concerned they will report that they will not repair this issue claiming it does not affect the photos. I am sincerely hoping that will not be the case. Hope to update this saga as I learn more.PART 2 The Adventure Continues... So Fujifilm received the camera the following Tuesday.  The camera was seen by a tech who examined it and apparently missed completely what the camera was sent in for. On the work order that was enclosed back with the camera he claimed he found dust on the lens and viewfinder which he cleaned. Obviously he completely missed seeing the spots inside the lens and the camera was returned in exactly the same condition it was in when it was sent to them. Clearly not happy at this point since it cost more than $22 for postage and insurance sending it to them via USPS. Called them back and to their credit apologized and told me to send the camera back to them at their cost. They would send me a FedEx label in the mail. It took four days to finally receive it. Sent the camera back to them, this time enclosing very clear photos of the spots in the lens with circles and arrows so it wouldn't be missed. The tech I spoke to also asked that I direct the package to his attention and he would personally check it out and call me while the camera was in front of him on his bench. This sounded good so even with the extra hassle I'm thinking this will get solved. Took the camera two or three days to reach them and I'm waiting to hear back from the tech when I get an email that the camera was already shipped out back to me. Puzzling, but I figured I'd wait to see the camera before doing anything else, thinking the tech saw the problem and just took care of it and a call wasn't necessary. Two days later the camera is delivered. The work order shows they changed the lens assembly. This is good. At least until I start to take test shots and it appears to me the autofocus is not calibrating correctly, most obviously in macro mode. I put the camera back in the box and called Fujifilm the next morning. I reach the same tech who I spoke to last time, who told me he never saw the camera and it must have been serviced by someone else despite the fact I had put 'Attention To:' and his name all over the label, the box, and the paperwork inside. Aside from being surprised this happened he was also very apologetic. I asked for a supervisor but none was available and the tech explained little could be done without the camera there in front of them for them to evaluate and determine what they would do next. This time, instead of waiting four days for a label to arrive he gave me the FedEx acct # so I could go over to FedEx that same day and overnight it back to them with a guaranteed 8:00 am next day delivery. Having lost confidence at this point they're ever going to get this camera right I told him I think they should provide me with a new replacement since, by this point, they've probably had the camera longer than I've had it. The tech said he couldn't promise anything but with the camera in hand he would advocate for me to his manager the next day and call me first thing the next morning. I waited the entire day to receive that phone call. I finally tried to reach him, twice, both times in the late afternoon, both times I was told he was in meetings. At 5:30 pm the same day I finally did get a call back, this time from the manager with whom I then went over the entire chain of events, including my request that the camera needs to be replaced with a new, and not refurb, camera. To his credit he really was trying to make this right for me but made me aware it would be difficult or impossible to swap this out for a new camera. He then hit upon a solution which he offered me, and which I accepted, which was explaining to me that on occasion Fujifilm gets cameras returned from camera dealers whose boxes were somewhat damaged when the retailer would open the delivery carton. He assured me the cameras are absolutely brand new but because the box may show some damage it therefore would not considered in saleable condition. After we finished our conversation he emailed me that he made inquiries and one such camera was available in California, and he had already requested it be sent to to him. He then emailed a few days later that the camera arrived but before sending it out to me he first wanted to completely check it out. The camera then arrived here two days later and was, as promised, a brand new boxed camera. The box had a spot where there was very slight, insignificantly damage, barely noticeable, and clearly irrelevant to affecting the camera. I emailed to thank him. So that's what happened... All the people at Fujifilm who I dealt with were all very nice, all very understanding, and all of them seemed to want to do the right thing, and eventually did, but somehow, at least in my case, things seemed to fall between the cracks quite a lot.. So then the real question is whether this was a typical or a unique experience with them and did I just get lucky finding the right person to solve this issue for me or would anyone else have also walked away satisfied they were dealt with properly - I have no way of knowing. Would I recommend to a friend they avoid buying Fujifilm products because of this? Absolutely not. Ultimately everyone at Fujifilm I dealt with, as I already said, was very nice and wanted to do the right thing, and, as I also said, eventually did exactly that.  That counts for a lot. So I guess that all you can really take away from this entire experience is that just sometimes s*** happens... What else can I say??...:-). And, by the way, the camera really is superb...","10 30, 2013",AS6DPJTQ7CSQC,Barry R.,54.0,Lens Coating Issue,37.0,468.0,1383091200.0,1236.0,45.6414747642,23.321795389,22.3196793752,0.0667134077406,0.0,0.872982907868

This is a long review, but I have addressed some technical issues here that may assist you if you have bought a Gopro Hero 3, or if you plan to.  I have put mine through its paces for nearly 2 weeks before posting this.The first thing you must do is update the firmware manually.  After several attempts with the automatic process, my Gopro -and many others I suspect- failed to update, and it was never at all apparent that the process failed.  After several days of use, the camera began to malfunction.  If you don't  get your firmware updated successfully, you are guaranteed to have major problems.Here is a quick guide on how to manually update your firmware:  (If you have a Mac, or are not computer-savvy, check online for more detailed instructions.  Lawrence M. Friedman posted a comprehensive how-to on Gethypoxic.)1. Jot down your serial number (both lines) from inside the battery port.  Insert a Class 10 micro SD, battery, and take a picture to ensure your card is good.  Ensure WiFi is off, and charge your camera to 2 bars if necessary.  (Steps 1-5 on the update instructions at GoPro.com.)  At this point, do not connect your Gopro to your PC.2. Instead, download the update files from Gopro.com onto your PC.  To do this, follow the prompts for 'manual update.'  Complete the registration fields.3. Connect the camera to your PC & power up.  Open your Gopro drive, then move the update files from your PC onto your Gopro.  DO NOT put the files into either folder (DCIM or Misc), just place the files next to those folders (root).4. Disconnect your GoPro from your PC, then turn it back on.  This should initiate the update process.IMPORTANT: Now pay attention to your Gopro LCD display. During the process, look for the message on your LCD that reads 'updating.'  Your front LED light will flash intermittently. You will soon see a progress percentage on your LCD and the blue WiFi light will turn on.  Make sure your progress climbs to 100%, then your camera will shut itself off.If you do not observe your camera behaving as I described, the update did not work and you will have to try again.  If the process fails, do not expect to receive an 'Update Failed' message as Gopro claims.  The firmware issue is causing huge problems for many users; largely because they believe that they successfully installed the new firmware, but the process actually failed.After my firmware was updated successfully, I have not experienced any of the major failures that many users have reported.  My battery does not drain overnight when turned off as some people have reported.  My camera never fails to read its SD card.  I started & stopped recording via WiFi repeatedly, and everything worked great.  Freezing is the major catastrophic problem common in the negative reviews.  I shot video for 45 minutes continuously and never had any lock-up issues during use.  I function-tested every option in the menu and never experienced any malfunction, but for one exception.My camera froze a few times when powering on, requiring a battery rip.  I'm not sure what causes this, and it happened only a few times over the past 2 weeks, while I have turned the camera on & off hundreds of times with no issues.  Some have theorized that it is related to using the USB charger, or moving files off of the SD card, but I have been unable to determine a common condition that will cause the problem consistently.  You can expect to experience this glitch too; it is a very common report on the Gopro forums, and I have friends that have had the same experiences.  We are hoping that Gopro will solve this issue with another firmware update. Note: If you are forced to pull the battery, leave it out for at least 60 seconds.  Update 7-3-13: After 4 months of heavy use, my Gopro Black is working flawlessly.  It has not frozen during use or startup after the latest firmware update (Version 2.39).  Some of my friends have experienced occasional freezing, but it's very rare; note: we use our Gopro H3B's on a daily basis.If you're going to buy a Hero 3, update the firmware manually right out of the box.  After that, if you have freezing issues, a defective battery, or buttons that do not work as they should, just take it back to the store for an exchange or refund.  Best Buy gives you 15 days.  I can't imagine dealing with any customer service trying to fix a lemon.  I don't get why anyone even tries.  That being said, my remaining criticisms are relatively petty, and are being made against a functional Hero 3 Black. The bottom line is that I love this camera so far.  It earns 4 stars.Be prepared for a fast-draining battery.  The 45-minute video I mentioned earlier took my battery from 100% to no bars.  However, after the 45-min recording, I was able to shoot an additional 28 minutes on fumes (with no bars showing on my battery gauge) before it died. This battery test was made on the 1080/60 setting, without WiFi or Protune in use.You will likely need a backup battery plan, such as spares with a wall charger.  There is a great kit on Amazon for $29 made by Wasabi,Wasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger for GoPro HD HERO3 and GoPro AHDBT-201, AHDBT-301or the Gopro battery Bacpac (which I have never tried).  Note: You can swap batteries and your settings will not return to factory defaults.  I left my battery out for 5 minutes and it still retained my settings.  This is a huge positive for Gopro since I routinely swap out batteries.  It would be a real pain to reset my resolution & preferences every time, not to mention the date/clock.  I use my Gopro for skydiving, which means my videos are short, and I am never far from an A/C outlet.  The battery life on the Hero 3 could pose a challenge for those who venture into the wilderness...or the water.  Something to think about.  I used a Hero 2 for a year, and the difference in the battery life is noticeable.  Note: It took 140 minutes to charge my battery from totally drained to 100%.  From the point of no bars to 100%, it took 100 minutes to fully charge.  These tests were done with the included USB cable connected to a PC.My other minor complaints include the lack of a printed manual.  I downloaded it from online, then printed the PDF, so I have a 66-page 8.5x11"" book.  A pocket-sized manual that I can fit in my camera case should be standard issue with a $400 package.  This is not too big of a deal because once you learn the system, there are only 6 to 8 pages from the manual that are actually useful.The panel that covers the charging port is not tethered, so I already know that this little door (14 x 21mm) will eventually get lost.  Another issue is that the unit gets hot while recording; but as long as it doesn't do any damage or cause a breakdown, I guess that's just the way it is.  A Gopro will not allow itself to overheat; it will shut down automatically if it gets too hot.When you open up your DCIM folder after recording, you may notice several blank-icon files (type LRV & THM) scattered among your video/picture files.  Some computer people call these ""mouse droppings.""  The LRV files can be changed to MP4 and are functional as a mini clip.  This is useful for efficient editing projects on slower computers.  After setting up your edit, you then replace the LRV with your original HD file.  The THM files can be changed to JPG and serve as thumbnails to your photographs. But I just delete all the droppings.  I don't fully understand how to exploit them, and they only show up once in a while.The greatest improvement over the Hero 2 is the new video options available.  The 1080p/60fps is my favorite setting.  This feature alone is the reason I bought the H3B.  The Hero 2 would only shoot 30FPS on 1080.  And to my delight, once I selected 1080/60 on my H3B, I found that I can then adjust the FOV within that setting.  On the hero 2, your FOV options were very limited depending on your resolution setting.  The H3B gives incredible freedom to customize the look of your recordings.  Note: The recording versatility on the Black edition is better than on the White or Silver models.  The premium price is not just for the remote.The 4k cinema mode is essentially useless to me.  It offers a maximum frame rate of 15 FPS, which resembles a slideshow.  The 2.7k offers 30 FPS, and renders incredibly impressive resolution, but you'll be lucky if your computer can play it smoothly.  After seeing the excellent results of the 1080p/60FPS videos, I doubt I will ever change that setting except to do super slow-motion, for which I would use 120FPS-- which is only available on 720p resolution.  Apparently, there is a plan from GoPro for an upcoming software update that will expand the FOV options on the 720/120FPS mode. Right now it's Wide only.  UPDATE 5-7-13: The new firmware update gives more FOV options.The WiFi remote is definitely cool and handy.  It makes it a snap to control your camera after it's mounted.  It is simple to set up and operate.  But like the camera, the remote battery drains quickly; and the charging cable is proprietary, so you will have to take it with you to charge the remote during downtime.  I also installed the GoPro app on my Android smartphone.  This allows you to use your phone as a remote.  You can see on your phone what the camera sees, even while it's not recording; lots of fun possibilities there.The camera is noticeably thinner and lighter than the H2.  The buttons are easier to activate; they are larger and more sensitive.  It also uses a Micro SD card, not the standard SD used by the Hero 2.  Because the height & width are unchanged, the casing doors are interchangeable with the Hero 2, and the LCD Bacpac from my H2 is fully functional on the 3; that made my day!The firmware situation is unfortunate, and Gopro owes a lot of customers a big apology.  I myself grew quite frustrated until I was advised to use the manual process.  This review was going to be a 1-star profanity-fest, until I figured out the firmware debacle.  If you disregarded all reviews of the Hero 3 in which the user failed to update the firmware, I'm sure the overall feedback would be much more positive.  Even after my initial troubles, I am still a fan of Gopro.  I can live with the power-up freezing glitch for now.  For skydiving and short trips, the Hero 3 Black is a great camera.

Here I would like to share my thought process as well as impression.  So anyone in similar situations as I was may be able to use this for guidance.First of all, I own tablet pc x 2 with most recent one purchased back in November 2010.  I also own itouch.  Never owned android product.Quick background for the reason I needed/wanted new tablet- Longer battery life: My tablet pc only lasted 5 hours- Lighter tablet: My tablet pc weighted 2.5 lbs- Bigger screen: My tablet pc had less than 9 inch screen, which was great for comic reading but not so great for work related document reading.Work related- To watch multiple work related video series- To read ebooks.  Some of which are not straight off kindle nor nook market, but rather converted books from other file formats such as chm or saved web pages.  Some of these files are huge in size (up to 200MB) and contain multiple images, tables, and applied CSS.- To view Microsoft Office files.  Some of these files are relatively large in size(over 10MB) with multiple images, textbox, and smartart.  These need to be accessible even when there is no internet connection.Personal use- To read digital comics- To watch streaming videos.Here are are my opinion about xoom wifi version so far.Pros1. Watching videos- Works very well without any lag or stuttering. Screen resolution is a bit higher than IPAD2, but doubt it is significant enough to be noticible.- One great thing about xoom is microSD support (not available yet).  As I need to have multiple DVD sets with each being 20+GB, rather than deleting/reloading videos here and there, I can simply have dedicated microSD for each DVD sets. Currently, the highest storage capacity of microSD goes upto 32GB.  If I had gone to IPAD2 route, I was going to go buy 64GB for maximum storage capacity, which may have been sufficient by itself but 32GB alone will not.2. Ebook reading- My ebooks are not typical.  They are in epub file formats.  Even on PC, only couple applications can render these files correctly.  On itune market, using itouch I could not find any application that can render my ebooks except Stanza, which came very close for one ebook, but clushed on the other and ibook came very close with the other book, but did not show any images on the one opened with Stanza.  So together was able to provide close to perfect solution. *Supposedly, ibook does not render images if they are within the table.On my xoom, I tried pretty much all the epub reader on android market.  None could render my files except one application, which actually rendered both books with complete original style and layout.  Minor issues are still there in this application such as bug with internal hyperlink.  But this is the best epub reader I have tried so far among pc, itune, and android market.  Just in case anyone is wondering, it is called StarBook.*Reason I said best and included PC here is two applications on PC that renderes my files correctly actually takes longer to open the epub files for some reason.3. Reading Digital Comic- Not to say much here.  Works perfectly.  Certainly, should work as greatly on ipad2.4. Watch streaming video- Flash 10 has been installed.  All the streaming video sites that I visit works just as on PC.  Definitely better than PS3 web browser.  However, I have read somewhere that playing Flash based games on xoom have significant lags.  As I don't play Flash based game, this was not an issue for me.  But Flash for Android Table OS is still beta version, so considering it is better I am sure many issue will resolve with final version.5. Customizability- Very impressive.  In fact, this is the one main reason that I suddenly became fan of android os.  It takes some learning and definitely not as Apple customer friendly interface.  But once you know how to customize this, you can basically make it into exactly the way you want.  Widget is awesome feature just like windows 7 widget, but seem more appropriate in tablet setting.  For instance, CNN widget updates highlight news every hour on my home screen without me clicking on the application.6. USB Connectivity- This can be both pros and cons.  But for me this is under pros.  As I just simply like to be able to drag and drop files, and be able to create my own folder organization.7. GPS- Surprised to see built in GPS.  Have not really played with, but apparently there is a way to have voice direction navigator using google map.Cons:1. Weight- Main negative for xoom here.  According to the technical specifications, in comparison to Ipad 2 xoom is 130g heavier.  It indeed does have bigger monitor, but for me, I'd rather have lighter tablet.  Despite overall weight is around 730g and significantly lighter than my asus 8 inch windows 7 based tablet, it is still noticible weight for me.  Especially holding on one hand or holding up in bed.  If this is the major concern, I recommend one to wait until June when Samsung Android based tablet that supposedly be lighter (by really small margin) than ipad 2 is released.2. View microsoft office files (primarily word document)- So far, I have not found any perfect word viwer application yet.  None of them can render textbox (maybe preminum version of Document2Go). None can recognize SmartArt.  Skydrive shows everything, but not crisp due to lack of SilverLight plugin support for android; besides, Skydrive will not work without internet.3. Slight learning curve- Never owned android product before.  There is definitely much more steeper learning curve with android os than the ipad os.  I didn't mind this or in fact, I enjoyed finding out new things.  But I cannot recommend android os product to my parents as they can hardly surf internet on pc. On the other hand, I am sure they will not have any issue learning ipad2.So for those who cannot decide, which one to get like I was.  Just list what your main use will be and compare each.  I am sure either will work out great.  But one thing I can say is that Android Tablet OS is real stuff.  I thought it could be buggy, lots of lags and so on.  But works as smoothly as you can imagine.","03 29, 2011",A1Y8UMAV7EXKV0,HoushaSen,65.0,Surprisingly good,74.0,514.0,1301356800.0,1115.0,85.7217907045,42.4479307515,43.273859953,0.0347742840635,0.0,0.872787135748

Also, you can finally disable the video button so no more accidental video clips. :)Now, the bad news.I really wanted to love this camera. Up until yesterday I have never had a problem with it overheating while taking video. Last night I had to shoot longer clips than I normally do because I wasn't sure when some of the action was going to happen. I did not shoot longer clips because I have no idea what I am doing and expect people to watch boring, unedited video clips.Right at the moment I was going to get some great shots, the camera shut down on me. NO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE LONGER THAN 3 MINUTE VIDEO CLIPS. IT WILL OVERHEAT AND SHUT DOWN. YOU MIGHT MISS ONCE IN A LIFETIME SHOTS. DONT RELY ON THIS CAMERA TO SHOOT VIDEO OF IMPORTANT EVENTS.I have been reading lots of reviews with people saying stuff like, long movies are boring. Why would you shoot long clips? Well, sometimes you have to shoot long clips to catch everything and THEN you edit it later. Please, stop making excuses for this camera. Overheating after 3 minutes is a serious limitation if you like to shoot video. Looks like I may go back to Panasonic and get the GH3 when it comes out. My GH2 never overheated and was not limited to 29.59 clips. The Nex7 is a nice stills camera but it is very frustrating if you need to shoot longer video clips.My original review is below....This camera has the potiential to be an amazing camera. They did so many things right and only a few things wrong. I love being able to get amazing picture quality without having to lug a brick around my neck all day.These are my observations after owning it for almost two months...These are things that need to be fixed.Video button needs to have an option to disable it (FIXED WITH FIRMWARE UPDATE), or make it a double press to activate it. It is too easy to hit it by mistake and then cause you to miss some shots because you don't realize it has been activated.Certain features require jpgs. The camera should automatically switch to jpg and then automatically switch back to your current setting.The back screen should be movable to any angle. (Like the Panasonic GH2)Jpg processing is not good. This needs to be addressed.The alignment grid should be available in different colors. Currently, it is black and is very hard to see when taking pics of darker subjects. I would love it had a red or yellow option.You should be able to save settings and quickly change to different shooting enviroments.Playback (for videos and pics) should be in the order they were taken. You shouldn't have to switch folders to view differnt file types. If they want to have different folders, they need to make it easier to switch folders. Perhaps, cycle through the different folders everytime you press the playback button.You should be able to set higher ISOs in smaller increments. It should not jump from 1600 to 3200 to 6400. If you need to use an ISO slightly higher than 1600 you should be able to set that and not have to jump all the way to 3200. (adding unwanted noise)Auto Panorama mode should be able to save a raw file and it should also let you pick the aperture.You should be able to save a default video setting. Very rarely do you want to use the same settings as still pics.Have a way for settings to transfer to Lightroom when you import them. Currently, they get tranferred with a generic setting. I am not sure if this is more of an Adobe or Sony problem.Video length is limited due to overheating. Sometimes limited to 3-5 minutes. Not good! My Panasonic Gh2 never overheated no matter how long the video was.FIXED WITH FIRMWARE UPDATE!!!!! Bracketing is too limited. -.7 and +.7? Really? It needs to be at least 2 stops over and under and also allow for more than 3 shots.Auto HDR should save as a raw file.Things they did right...Focus peaking! Love it! It is incredibly useful. Thank you!!View finder! Very nice! I wish the pics looked as good on my laptop screen! :)Size and weight! Love it.Configurable buttons. Very useful.Picture quality when using RAW. Amazing detail with a good lens.Kit lens isn't as bad as everyone says it is. (in real world use-not looking at test charts all day long)Movable focus area. Very useful. My 60d makes me chose on of the fixed focus locations. Not as useful.Harldy any shutter lag! Thank you.10 frames per second! I have never used it yet but there may be a day when I need it.PLEASE SONY! DON'T FORGET ABOUT US. WE ARE WAITING FOR A FIRMWARE UPDATE TO FIX A LOT OF THESE ISSUES. PLEASE DON'T JUST MAKE A NEW CAMERA THAT FIXES THESE ISSUES. WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS CAMERA AND WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO BUY A NEW CAMERA JUST TO FIX SOME OVERSIGHTS.FIXED WITH FIRMWARE UPDATE!","08 23, 2012",A3IXXWSTNWCS4G,David A.

That being written, I am pleasantly surprised by the Zune 80 gb player.  I have owned hard-drive based MP3 players since 2003 when I bought my first one.  I was recently using the 5G 60gb iPod and it needed replacing so I start researching players again.  After a great deal of research, I bought the Zune but didn't open it right away.  I waited a few days.  That was a mistake.  For a few days, I just used the free Zune software.  I have read some reviews that the software is terrible. I initally agreed but after learning it, I realized I reacted in haste.  Sometimes it is a bigger challenge to 'unlearn' other product's software.  That was my case.  Now I like its simplicity.  I would recommend some improvements to it though but it is fine in a general sense.  The player is quite good.  The sound of the music, to me, is better than my iPod.  I did a direct comparision listening to the exact same songs with the same headphones on each device and that is how I drew my conclusion. I have read a review that reported a great deal of problems with synching and so forth.  I have experienced none of those issues.  No doubling of songs.  I do see it run back through the list of everything but it isn't resynching everything.  To me, it is checking the index of the Zune software's list of files to the index on the Zune looking for differences to know what to synch or ignore.  Here is my list of Pros and Cons for the Zune 80.Pros:*Better sounding music (even without equalizer - go figure)*Choice to use click method and/or touch.  If you aren't a huge fan of the iPod click-wheel, you will really appreciate the Zune.  I love that change.  The touch function is more natural.  To scroll up, run your finger up on the touch pad.  To scroll down, run your finger down.  Or just click on the top/bottom/left/right of the touch pad to navigate.  Again, it really is very natural to use.*Extremely easy on the eyes.  This is a pleasure to view.  Easy to read.*Friendly navigation.  Again, unlearning other players is the biggest hurdle but worth getting to know the device.  Once you do, you will really like this device.*Larger viewing screen.*Radio - with RDBS.  Very nice feature.*Supports Podcasts.  I subscribed to X-Play's video game review podcast with no problems.*Nicer headphones included.  They come with headphones that have inserts to help find a better fit.*The quick add playlist is very friendly to use.  I didn't really like the iPod one mostly because I wasn't a huge fan of the clickwheel.*Substantial feel.  It handles like a quality effort was put into it.Cons:*Battery life.  Not long enough for me.*Some software design improvements needed on the Zune device and the Zune software on the pc.  I could list a set of improvements but I won't.  They are more tweaks that I believe the development team could easily add.  My field is software so I know I view things from a different perspective.Overall:  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  I am glad I did not buy another iPod.  I am excited about music again thanks to this player.  I am actually looking forward to buying CD's and DRM-free music.  And remember, there is no such thing as a perfect digital player.  Keep an open mind when you are browsing for players.  There are many good choices out there, not just one.  Oh, and please don't give away music.  Pay for it so the artist that you love can devote their creative talents to making even more music.  (No - I don't work in the music industry in any way.  I just want to at least support the artists that make the music I want to hear.)","12 16, 2007",AEJJH9OG0QMCQ,"ILoveGadgets ""Gadgets always fit""",62.0,Pleasant Surprise - goodbye iPod,65.0,330.0,1197763200.0,681.0,22.7229332558,11.4655485212,11.2573847347,0.132838981465,0.0,0.872749206163

I expected to just use the device for a few weeks and then go back to my desktop system.  But instead I changed a few of my habits and stayed with it ever since.  There is very little difference between the Cr-48 and the production Samsung.  Size is about the same, keyboard almost identical.  Cr-48 was coated with a rubbery material that you either like or hate.  Samsung is more traditional glossy plastic.Both machines have very bright and crisp displays in a wide format.  The screen itself is of the traditional non-glare type.  I can't imagine why anyone would want a screen with glare but I notice many new systems come that way.  I guess if you work in a totally dark room the glossy screens are fine.  The second version of the Chromebook from Acer is said to have a glossy screen for anyone that wants that.I'll second what others said that this machine is not for everyone.  If you a big user of Apple products and happy with their ""roadmap"" to the future, stay with them.  If you need all the specialized software that only runs on Windows, then you'd better stay there too.But... If you are tired of running virus scanners, clean-up utilities, disk defragmenters, firewalls, and tired of having to ask a relative or neighbor to get your machine working again (or worse having to pay someone to do it) then cloud-based computing may be for you.Chrome OS is a slimmed down (very) version of Linux that boots in 8 seconds and awakes from sleep almost instantly.  There is no desktop, so the graphical interface is the Chrome web browser which takes up the whole screen as soon as you log-on to the machine.  There are some ""hidden"" aspects to this OS, but you can only get to them by flipping a special switch for those who like to experiment, and the machine keeps track of the fact that you have done this.  Security experts know that no system is safe if you grant physical access to an attacker, but the Chrome notebook does everything it can to protect your locally stored information (even though there isn't much of that).  Each user must log into the machine and that causes his and only his files to become unencrypted for use.  Signing off causes those files to be encrypted again.  But very little data is stored on the machine anyway and the entire solid state ""disk"" is only 16 gig, so pack-rats need not apply.  The idea is that you store all your documents in the cloud (you are not limited to using Google products to do this of course).  While you *can* download files, typically you do so simply to turn around and upload them somewhere else.  You can display photos and play MP3 and MP4 files locally but that is about it (for now anyway).  In addition to the SSD space you can store local files on a USB stick or memory card (as used in cameras).  Theoretically files you store on the SSD drive will get erased automatically after a while (like a month, though I haven't seen this happen yet).  So if you feel you just HAVE to have some files to carry around with you, a 16G USB stick is probably advisable.If you want to let a friend use the machine, just sign off and they can use ""Guest mode"" and your stuff will be safe, no matter what they do.  Also anything they do will get erased when they are done.  If someone else will be using he machine regularly they can also sign in with a Google ID rather than using Guest mode and their files and yours will be kept isolated from one another.I'm not sure what it is I like about this keyboard as it mostly resembles other ""island keyboards"" but I bang pretty hard on the keys and they usually register without too many mistakes.  I don't feel that I am in danger of breaking the thing as is the case with many new notebooks or keyboards.  The mousepad as others have mentioned is HUGE.  I am not a big fan of mousepads so even with a notebooks I tend to carry a mouse with me.  I recently went visiting needed to use the mousepad for a while though and found it acceptable.  I'd say a cut below the Apple mouspads, but not by much.  Remember that most of what you get from a mousepad is done in software, not hardware.  When the Cr-48s came out there were lots of complaints about the mousepads being almost unusable, but with each new release of the OS things got better and I'm sure that will continue.With Chrome OS being a young product so far there is still room for improvement, but the improvements are coming fairly regularly and they are totally non-disruptive, downloading in the background and automatically activating the next time you boot.  Even that first boot after update doesn't seem to take longer as with some OSs.There are three ""Channels"" for updates: Stable, Beta, and Dev(eloper) depending on how risk averse you are.  There is also a USB stick based recovery procedure should your machine get ""hosed"" which can happen on the developer channel or when playing with the developer switch.Why is there a developers switch?  Well, security is a big goal of Chrome OS.  There are no virus scanners needed, but the OS does do a self-check during those 8 seconds it is booting up, and when your files are decrypted they are check for tampering as well.  The developers switch bypasses some of this paranoia, and also gives you access to additional parts of the file system that are normally off-limits.  In addition you are given access to a more complete set of Linux/Unix commands some of which could get you into trouble.  People have run other version of Linux, Windows and even the Apple OS on Chromebooks by flipping the developer switch, but then that is rather missing the point of a machine that is designed specifically for cloud-based computing.  On the other hand, if you have been keeping your stuff in the cloud, and happen to trash your system while on the road, getting it going again doesn't take too long or involve too many steps (and I suspect might eventually only entail pressing a reset button or something).Finally, on communications, WiFi set-up is as easy or easier than Windows or Apple machines I've used.  Previous connections are memorized by default.  All the protocols up to and including ""n"" ""just work"".  In a pinch you can tap into the 100M of free Verizon wireless 3G coverage.  In a real pinch they have various for-pay coverage after that.  I've tried it just long enough to know that it works.  On a trip I can imagine tapping into the ""unlimited"" plan for a day at a time between WiFi enabled hotels.Cons: (1) I wouldn't have minded a wired Internet option as well, but with notebooks getting thinner and thinner it would probably be hard to squeeze the connector in there.  So far the ""n"" version of WiFi maxes out my router's speed anyway.  (2) Only VGA connectivity to external monitors... else I might be tempted to use this as a desktop machine with a larger monitor.  If there is indeed a Samsung ""mini"" desktop system waiting in the wings that will probably be a better way to go anyway (and might well be significantly cheaper than a laptop). (3) There is a way to go for ""apps"" for this ecosystem.  there are advanced applications that demonstrate what *can* be done such as music composition, technical drawings, photo editing (and of course Google Docs which handles normal office needs) but almost everyone will run into situations that require a ""legacy"" system to handle.  For example, you currently have to use a special set-up on a Windows or Apple machine to print, unless you have one of the very new ""e-printers"" that have an e-mail address associated with them and support their own network connection.  If the Google ""roadmap"" holds steady I fully expect these issue to be addressed in the not too distant future.In the mean time, I'm sitting comfortably here on my couch with my Chromebook, and not tempted to sit at the desk where I have a ""more powerful"" system.  Come to think of it, I have more power in the cloud than I could ever afford at home.  With proper interfaces, everything I could need.","06 16, 2011",A3NCYNYH30C12D,Amazon Customer,58.0,Chromebooks Go Production,858.0,593.0,1308182400.0,1479.0,22.9979493556,11.6417687263,11.3561806293,0.131539912783,0.0,0.872861789939
